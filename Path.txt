      She was admitted to the clinic for urgent indications with complaints of dull diffuse headache, dizziness, rise in blood pressure to 170/100 mm Hg, chest discomfort with irradiation to the left arm with little physical exertion, shortness of breath, palpitations; heartburn, belching sour, nausea, vomiting; soreness in the shoulder, knee, ankle, small joints of the hands and feet, itching of the skin of the face, hands, forearms, hyperemia of the back and wings of the nose, swelling of the face in the morning; weight gain, general weakness; internal discomfort and feeling of lack of air mainly at night; dull aching pain in the lumbar region.
       	Anamnesis morbi: She fell ill acutely in November 2005, when, against the background of relative well-being, severe morning stiffness, soreness, redness and swelling appeared in the area of ​​small joints of both hands, shoulder, elbow and knee joints, fever up to 400C, sweating, severe general weakness, rapid fatigue. On November 14, she was examined by a general practitioner, and a course of anti-inflammatory therapy (diclofenac retard, prednisone 30 mg/day) was prescribed, which resulted in a significant improvement in her state of health. Due to the deterioration of her condition in January 2006, she was hospitalized at military unit 25515 with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, seropositive, articular form. She received cytostatic therapy with methotrexate, mini-pulse therapy with methylprednisolone, movalis, physiotherapy with a positive effect. Subsequently, against the background of outpatient cytostatic therapy (methotrexate 7.5 mg/week, prednisolone 10 mg/day), she felt satisfactory for the next three months. In May 2006, against the background of constant use of methotrexate, prednisolone and washing, pain, heaviness in the epigastric region and nausea after taking medications, in the left and right hypochondria, appeared, and therefore she independently refused to take medications. Against the background of refusal of treatment, the pain in the joints intensified, pains in the right elbow joint joined, subfibrile fever appeared. She resumed taking medications again without a positive effect. 26.06.06 for urgent indications, she was hospitalized in the rheumatology department of the NLMK Medical Unit, where she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus for the first time. Received treatment: methotrexate 10 mg/week, prednisolone 20 mg/day, movalis, chimes, pentoxifylline, physiotherapy with a positive effect. However, against the background of constant intake of these drugs, at the end of October 2006, pain in the joints increased again, there was hyperemia of the back of the nose and cheeks, itching of the skin of the face, hands, swelling on the face and hands, periodic pain behind the sternum and in the left half of the chest, palpitations, shortness of breath with little physical exertion, general weakness, pain in the mouth, nagging pain in the lumbar region after physical exertion and a decrease in the dose of prednisolone taken. Stationary held a course of plasmapheresis and plasmasorption, pulse therapy with methylprednisolone. After this course of therapy in the next 6 months, while taking 10 mg of prednisolone and 7.5 mg of methotrexate, she felt well. Exacerbations of the disease were noted in October-November 2007 and February-March 2007 and 2008, however, an increase in the dose of prednisolone to 80 mg/day for 3 weeks, followed by a gradual decrease in the dose to 15-40 mg/day, made it possible to stop exacerbations. Annually, she underwent planned inpatient treatment for the underlying disease, where the dose of medications taken was adjusted.
	The last exacerbation of the disease was noted in September 2008. In the day hospital regimen, treatment was carried out: regimen, diet, intravenously: pulse therapy "Solu-medrol" 1000 mg (18.09.08 and 19.09.2008), asparkam, cardionate, cytoflavin and riboxin No. 5, neoton 4g No. 2, vitamins: C, B1, trental No. 3, cerebrolysin No. 1, piracetam No. 3, prednisolone 40 mg in the morning, methotrexate 10 mg / week. After the therapy, there was a short-term improvement in well-being, however, from mid-October, the condition progressively worsened in the form of discomfort behind the sternum with irradiation to the left arm and shortness of breath with little physical exertion (rise to the 1st floor), palpitations, heartburn, sour belching, nausea, pain in the chest. shoulder, knee, ankle, small joints of the hands, feet, swelling of the face in the morning, general weakness, internal discomfort and itching of the skin of the face, forearms, hands, as well as a feeling of lack of air mainly at night, hyperemia of the back and wings of the nose. An increase in the dose of methotrexate taken up to 15 mg/week and prednisolone up to 40 mg/day did not lead to the desired result. The existing complaints, despite taking omeprazole and almagel for the purpose of gastroprotection, were accompanied by pain in the epigastric region, heartburn, sour belching, nausea, episodic vomiting after taking medications, progressively increasing general weakness, numbness in the fingers and toes. On an outpatient basis in the clinic in the general blood test, signs of a mild degree of normochromic anemia were revealed, laboratory data for the activity of the process (increased ESR, CRP) were not noted, and therefore hospitalization in the rheumatology department was recommended in a planned manner. brushes, as well as a feeling of lack of air mainly at night, hyperemia of the back and wings of the nose.

	Over the past two years, he has noted an increase in blood pressure up to 170/110 mmHg, accompanied by dizziness, nausea, and palpitations. He takes antihypertensive drugs regularly (noliprel 2 mg in the morning). For the first time, systolic murmur over the apex of the heart appeared in 2006, with time its intensity increased. Episodic pain in the epigastric region notes for ten years, was treated independently with a temporary positive effect. During the last two years, she notes unsteadiness when walking, numbness in the fingers of the upper limbs, she was not treated, she did not seek medical help.
	Around 5:00 p.m. on November 17, 2008. I woke up with an unbearable headache and nausea. There was a single vomiting of food eaten the day before. Given the increase in blood pressure to 170/100 mm Hg. self-administered captopril 50 mg po, nifedipine 10 mg po without effect. Given the appearance of flies before the eyes, severe heaviness in the head, nausea, weakness caused an ambulance. She was taken to the VMA Hospital Therapy Clinic for further diagnosis and treatment.

Technical commentary on the study 11/15/2006:
Antibodies to the common extractable nuclear antigen of antibodies to the 60 kDa SS-A antigen have been found Antibodies to the 60 kDa Ro/SS-A antigen are relatively more frequently detected in patients with SLE than in those with Sjogren's syndrome and skin forms. Antibodies to the 60 kDa Ro/SS-A antigen are relatively more frequently detected in patients with SLE than in Sjogren's syndrome and cutaneous lesions, secondary dry syndrome, photosensitivity, and articular syndrome. A dangerous manifestation of SLE associated with antibodies against Ro / SS-A 60 kDa is the syndrome of congenital lupus, which develops in newborns from parturient women with SLE. This disease is based on the penetration of antibodies to Ro/SS-A into the blood of the newborn through the placenta. The main manifestation of congenital lupus is dermatosis and lesions of internal organs, including congenital transverse AV blockade, hepatitis, hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Antibodies to dsDNA are the main serological marker of SLE with kidney damage, since they are involved in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis, in addition, they are included in the 10th criterion of SLE. Low titers of anti-DNA antibodies without concomitant ANF and antibodies to an extractable nuclear antigen can be observed against the background of viral and infectious diseases and, if isolated, are not a sign of SLE. There is a correlation between the increase in titers of antinuclear factor (ANF), antibodies to dsDNA and hypocomplementemia before the development of an exacerbation of SLE, which requires periodic determination of titers of antibodies to dsDNA and the level of complement factors C3 and C4 in all patients with SLE with a frequency of once every 3-6 months.

After discharge, he feels well for 2 weeks, but later on there is a progressive increase in the feeling of weakness, shortness of breath, which requires re-hospitalization. In February, March and April 2011, for the reasons described above, she underwent inpatient treatment, where punctures of the pleural cavity and evacuation of the contents were performed. In June 2011, she was hospitalized in order to exclude a neoplasm (mesothelioma) at the Federal State Institution “Research Institute of Oncology named after N.N. N.N. Petrov” of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation, where after a comprehensive examination, including pleural biopsy and thoracoscopy, no data for the neoplasm were obtained. Diagnosed with idiopathic right-sided hydrothorax, ischemic cardiomyopathy. Subsequently, she underwent inpatient treatment at the Regional Cardiological Dispensary of the Leningrad Region. After release, within 2 months she felt satisfactory, however, in the future, due to progressive weakness on an outpatient basis, at least 2,000 ml of fluid was evacuated monthly during punctures of the right pleural cavity. During hospitalization in March 2012, during the drainage of the pleural cavity from March 5 to March 8, about 6000 ml of hemorrhagic exudate was obtained, a drop in hemoglobin from 144 to 80 g/l was noted, which was the reason for transfer to a surgical hospital, where data for ongoing intrapleural bleeding was not received, received conservative therapy, terilitin therapy. Discharged with subfebrile fever. Due to the deterioration of health in May 2012 in the form of severe fever, pain in the right half of the chest, she was hospitalized in the hospital surgery clinic, where she underwent inpatient treatment for pleural empyema on the right. After discharge, she felt relatively well. October 2012 general weakness began to progressively increase again, tolerance to physical activity sharply decreased, and the stomach increased in volume. She underwent inpatient treatment in the hospital therapy clinic with a positive effect. During the year, there was a slow progression of ascitic phenomena, which by November 2013. acquired a pronounced decompensated character and required another hospitalization. She was hospitalized by an ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic for further diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis at discharge: “Chronic viral hepatitis B, cirrhotic stage (Child-Pugh class B).

      Complaints: headaches mainly in the occipital region of the head, episodic dizziness, absent-mindedness after psycho-emotional stress; fast fatigue; decrease in performance.
      Medical history: Episodic headaches against the background of high blood pressure have been noted since 2007, but he did not seek medical help due to fear of being dismissed from military service. Upon admission to the VATT in 2008, the VVK was diagnosed as “healthy”. After admission, against the background of increased psycho-emotional stress, headaches became more frequent. On the recommendation of friends, he began to periodically measure blood pressure, while he noted a stable increase in blood pressure at the level of 140/100 mm Hg. Art. with periodic increases up to 170/100 mm Hg. In 2009, due to a significant increase in blood pressure (220/140 mmHg), he was hospitalized in 17 m / o 442 OVKG from February 18 to March 10, 2009, with a diagnosis of "Hypertension of the first stage (borderline). Hypertensive crisis from 17.02.2009, stopped with medication” (discharge summary No. 3434). After discharge, he does not take regular therapy. Occasionally, with an increase in blood pressure over 150/100 mm Hg. independently takes captopril with a moderate effect (“working” blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg).
       A real deterioration in well-being over the past month, when rapid fatigue began to appear with previously tolerated physical exertion, with psychoemotional stress, frequent rises in blood pressure up to 190/110 mm Hg began to be noted, headaches with nausea developed, which required additional intake of antihypertensive drugs. funds (captopril up to 100 mg under the tongue). 
       Independently applied to the medical service 104 CDC, from where, given the inadequacy of the self-treatment, he was sent for hospitalization in order to diagnose and select adequate therapy.

      .
      Complaints: pressing and constricting pain behind the sternum, shortness of breath, mainly of an inspiratory nature, arising from slight physical exertion (walking 50-70 m or climbing 10 steps), stopped by rest for 5 minutes. or taking nitroglycerin; increase in blood pressure up to 180/125 mm. rt. Art., accompanied by a dull headache without a clear localization; discomfort in the left half of the chest against the background of a feeling of interruptions in the work of the heart, moderate general weakness, increased fatigue; memory loss.
     
     Anamnesis of the disease: For a long time suffers from ischemic disease and hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus. Repeatedly underwent inpatient treatment in various hospitals of the city. The last hospitalization was in March 2010 in the 26th hospital in St. Petersburg with a diagnosis of progressive angina pectoris (medical documentation not provided). Regularly takes: amlodipine 10+5 mg/day, sotalol 80+40 mg/day, hypothiazide 25 mg/day, diroton 5 mg in the evening, cordarone 100 mg/day, preductal 2+2 tab/day, diabetone MV 30 mg in the morning and siofor 500 mg in the evening. Against the background of ongoing therapy, hemodynamics is stable at the "target" level of blood pressure 130-140/60-70 mm Hg, pulse 56-66 per minute. Over the past 2 weeks, she began to occasionally notice paroxysms of a feeling of palpitations with interruptions in the work of the heart that occur acutely against the background of relative well-being, lasting up to 6 hours, stopping on their own or after taking 400 mg of cordarone. During the last 10 days, she began to notice the occurrence of angina attacks with previously tolerated physical exertion, which required the use of nitroglycerin more often than usual. Given the ineffectiveness of self-administered therapy, she called an ambulance team, which was hospitalized in the ICU of the hospital therapy clinic.

       Complaints at admission: pronounced palpitations, "lump in the throat", pronounced weakness, pressing pain in the region of the heart, pain in the shoulder, knee and small joints of the hands, their stiffness in the morning for 2 hours, swelling of the face in the morning, internal discomfort, itching of the skin of the face, episodic sharp chilliness in the fingers and toes; nausea when taking medications, heaviness in the epigastric region when eating; weight loss within 4 months by 10 kg. 
       
Disease history:
       She fell ill acutely in November 2005, when, against the background of relative well-being, severe morning stiffness, soreness, redness and swelling appeared in the area of ​​small joints of both hands, shoulder, elbow and knee joints, fever up to 400C, sweating, severe general weakness, and rapid fatigue. On November 14, she was examined by a general practitioner, and a course of anti-inflammatory therapy (diclofenac retard, prednisone 30 mg/day) was prescribed, which resulted in a significant improvement in her state of health. She underwent inpatient treatment at military unit 25515 with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, seropositive, articular form. She received cytostatic therapy, mini-pulse therapy with methylprednisolone, movalis, physiotherapy with a positive effect. In the future, against the background of outpatient cytostatic therapy (methotrexate 7.5 mg/week, prednisolone 10 mg/day), pain, heaviness in the epigastrium, left and right hypochondria appeared, and therefore in May 2006 she independently refused to take medications. Against the background of refusal of treatment, the pain in the joints intensified, pains in the right elbow joint joined. She resumed taking medications again without a positive effect.
       26.06.06 was hospitalized in the rheumatology department of the NLMK Medical Unit, where she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus for the first time. Received treatment: methotrexate 10 mg/week, prednisolone 20 mg/day, movalis, chimes, pentoxifylline, physiotherapy with a positive effect. However, against the background of the constant intake of these drugs, at the end of October 2006, pain in the joints increased again, hyperemia of the back of the nose and cheeks, itching of the skin of the face, swelling on the face and hands, periodic pain behind the sternum and in the left half of the chest, palpitations, shortness of breath with slight physical exertion, general weakness, sore throat, pain in the lumbar region during physical exertion.
       In 2008, 2009, she underwent inpatient treatment using efferent therapy methods for repeated exacerbations of systemic lupus erythematosus with a moderate effect. 
       Over the past three years, he has been noted an increase in blood pressure up to 170/110 mmHg, accompanied by dizziness, nausea, and palpitations. From the same time - unsteadiness when walking, numbness in the fingers of the upper limbs. 
       In May 2010, she underwent inpatient treatment for progressive angina pectoris. Over the next year, there were attacks of stable angina, characteristic of level 2 FC. Occasionally noted attacks of palpitations, mainly at night, lasting up to 20 minutes, stopped on their own.
       Episodic pain in the epigastric region notes for ten years, was treated independently, taking a large number of antisecretory and antacid drugs, with a temporary positive effect. On December 22, 2010, laparoscopic surgery was performed to eliminate the incarceration of the paraesophageal hernia (laparoscopic posterior crurorrhaphy, Nissen-Rosetti fundoplication. K 44.9). 
        At the time of hospitalization, he regularly takes: Prednisone 5 mg - 2 tab. in the morning with breakfast until 9 am - all the time; Methotrexate 2.5 mg - 1 tab. 3 times a week (Saturday morning and evening 1 tab., Sunday morning 1 tab.) - constantly; Sorbifer durules - 1 capsule in the morning; Movalis - 1 suppository in the morning with exacerbation of the articular syndrome; Concor-core - 1 tab. in the morning.
        Real deterioration: on May 9, 2011, at about 9 am, I woke up from pressing pain in the left side of my chest, pronounced palpitations, and significant general weakness. Independently took the entire list of medications taken without effect. Given the ineffectiveness of self-therapy, she called an ambulance team, which was taken to the hospital therapy clinic for diagnosis and treatment with a diagnosis of "first-time detected paroxysm of atrial fibrillation."
       
       Objective status at admission: Height 164 cm, body weight at admission 64 kg. The general condition is severe, due to signs of electrical instability of the myocardium, arrhythmogenic shock. The position is passive. Satisfactory nutrition: BMI 24.4 kg/m2. The skin in the "décolleté" area is hyperpigmented, ecchymosis on the skin of the face, chest, abdomen, and extremities. Peripheral (submandibular, maxillary, cervical and axillary) lymph nodes are moderately enlarged, painless on palpation, not soldered to surrounding tissues. Movement in the joints is not limited, in the ankle, knee and small joints of the hands are moderately painful, edematous. On palpation of the radial arteries, the pulse is non-synchronous, the same on both hands, rhythmic, with a frequency of 158 beats. per minute, weak filling, uniform, weak tension, the vascular wall is palpated outside the pulse wave. The monitor registers supraventricular tachycardia with a heart rate of 158/min. SatO2=92%. Blood pressure: on the right shoulder - 80/60, on the left shoulder - 80/60 mm Hg. Art. Limits of relative cardiac dullness: right and upper are normal; left - on the left mid-clavicular line. The heart sounds are deaf, over the apex of the heart the 1st tone is weakened, systolic murmur at the apex. The respiratory rate is 24 per minute. On auscultation over the lungs, breathing is hard, multiple congestive rales are heard in the lower lobes of both lungs. The abdomen is soft and painless. The size of the liver according to Kurlov is 10x9x7 cm. Tapping in the lumbar region is painless. left - on the left mid-clavicular line. The heart sounds are deaf, over the apex of the heart the 1st tone is weakened, systolic murmur at the apex. The respiratory rate is 24 per minute. On auscultation over the lungs, breathing is hard, multiple congestive rales are heard in the lower lobes of both lungs. The abdomen is soft and painless. The size of the liver according to Kurlov is 10x9x7 cm. Tapping in the lumbar region is painless. left - on the left mid-clavicular line. The heart sounds are deaf, over the apex of the heart the 1st tone is weakened, systolic murmur at the apex. The respiratory rate is 24 per minute.

The size of the liver according to Kurlov is 10x9x7 cm. Tapping in the lumbar region is painless.
       
      As a result of the treatment: According to vital indications at 11:45 09.05.2011, taking into account the significant hemodynamic significance of tachycardia paroxysm, transthoracic electrical cardioversion was performed - sinus rhythm was restored. 
     Regime, diet No. 10, metabolic, hypotensive, antianginal, antiarrhythmic, vascular therapy, cytostatics, glucocorticosteroids, health improved, heart rate stabilized, manifestations of heart failure stopped, blood pressure stabilized at the target level (120-135 / 80-90 mmHg. Art.).

      Anamnesis of the disease He considers himself ill since February 18, 2011, when, against the background of complete well-being, he noted weakness, malaise, body aches, fever to febrile values ​​​​(39.0 ° C), dry cough. He did not apply for medical help, he independently took NSAIDs, antiviral agents (ingaverin). Over the next 6 days, weakness, fatigue increased, chills periodically occurred, increased sweating, body aches, a cough appeared with a small amount of sputum. 24.02. and on February 25, 2011, he felt better, noted a decrease in body temperature to subfebrile numbers, and went to work. From the middle of the day on February 25, 2011, weakness, chills resumed, an increase in body temperature up to 39.00C was again noted, and the general state of health worsened. In the future, the complaints described above intensified, there was a sharp weakness, making it difficult to move around the room. On March 2, 2011, an ambulance was taken to the HT clinic for urgent indications, at the prehospital stage, due to the identified severe hypotension, 400 ml of Quadrosol solution, 16 mg of Dexamethasone solution were intravenously administered.  
      Over the past 30 years, he has been suffering from bronchial asthma (atopic form), constantly taking Seretide 25 mcg / 125 mcg PDA. Asthmatic status in 2006. In the 1990s, psoriasis was diagnosed.

On the radial arteries, a threadlike pulse is palpable, the same on both hands, rhythmic, with a frequency of 118 per minute, weak filling and tension. Arterial pressure: 60/- mm. rt. Art. On auscultation, the heart sounds are muffled, rhythmic, the first tone at the apex is sharply weakened. The chest is of the correct form, symmetrical. The respiratory rate when breathing atmospheric air is 32 per minute, shallow breathing. With comparative percussion, dullness of percussion sound is determined in the projection of the lower loli of the lungs. Auscultation over the lungs on both sides is determined by hard breathing; over all fields of the lungs on both sides, foci of multiple moist sonorous small bubbling rales are heard. SatO2 without inhalation of humidified oxygen 78-82%, with inhalation - 88%. The edge of the liver protrudes from under the costal arch by 3 cm, soft-elastic consistency, sharp, somewhat painful on palpation. The spleen is not palpable. Ragosa's symptom is positive.
      As a result of the treatment: 
• IVL with PEEP within 3 hours from the moment of admission, 
• inotropic support for 2.5 days (maximum dose of dopamine 10 µg/kg×day), removed from inotropic support at 23:30 on 04.03.11 .HELL when transferring = / mmHg 
• continuous mask oxygen therapy, 
• complex metabolic and detoxification therapy (neoton 4g/day, cytoflavin 10 ml/day, mildronate 10 ml/day, calcium gluconate (correction of significant hypocalcemia), ascorbic acid), 
• avelox 400 mg 1 r/day,

      The right subclavian vein was catheterized on March 2, 2011. 
      At present, he is oxygen-dependent (when breathing atmospheric air, Sat O2 = 88%!) 
      
      Results of instrumental studies: 
      X-ray of the chest organs on March 2, 2011: bilateral polysegmental infiltration of the pulmonary pattern with increased pattern of the pleura . 
      ECG 02; 03.02; 03/04/2011: sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 118 per minute, horizontal EOS, left ventricular hypertrophy. Subsequently, a decrease in heart rate is noted.

Clinical outcome (underline): recovery, improvement, no change, chronicity, disability 
Outcome: discharged due to improvement 

      Admission complaints: moderate weakness, sweating, thirst, dry mouth, shortness of breath and discomfort in the left half of the chest with moderate physical exertion, periodically headaches mainly in the occipital region, weight gain.
     History of the disease: in 2006, during inpatient examination and treatment, type 2 diabetes mellitus was first detected. The level of sugar in the blood measures independently when absolutely necessary with the Aku Chek glucometer. The patient has been suffering from ischemic heart disease and hypertension for a long time since 2000. He was repeatedly hospitalized in various clinics of the Military Medical Academy. The last hospitalization in the HT clinic was from 18.01 to 03.02.2010. He did not take antihypertensive and hypoglycemic drugs. Over the past year, he has noted an increase in blood pressure rises, an increase in the severity of headaches. 
     Present worsening: during the last week he noted an increase in blood glucose levels up to 20 mmol / l (measured independently). In this connection, he turned to the GT clinic and was hospitalized.
     Objective status at admission: general condition of moderate severity, due to decompensation of diabetes mellitus, the manifestation of which is diabetic ketosis. Hypersthenic constitution. Increased nutrition. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Heart rate 88 per minute, no deficit, rhythmic pulse, satisfactory properties. On auscultation, the heart sounds are muffled, the emphasis of the second tone is on the aorta, BP is 120/80 mm Hg, there is vesicular breathing in the lungs, no wheezing. the abdomen is soft, painless on palpation, the liver is along the edge of the costal arch, effleurage along the lumbar region is painless on both sides.
     The following treatment was carried out: parenterally: glucose (5%-200 ml/day), MgSO4 (25%-5 ml/day), KCl (5%-30 ml/day), Humulin (12 U/day) . Inside: aspirin 100 mg/day, galvusmet 150/1500 mg/day, enalapril 5 mg/day, verapamil 120 mg/day. 
     As a result of the treatment, the state of health improved, blood glucose was within acceptable limits, cardiac pain syndrome did not recur, exercise tolerance was satisfactory, blood pressure was within normal values.  
     
     
     
The results of instrumental studies: 
ECG on December 23, 2011: heart rate - 100 per minute. Moderate sinus tachycardia. The horizontal position of the electrical axis of the heart to the left. Hypertrophy of the left heart. Violation of repolarization processes in the region of the posterior wall.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY 20.12.2011 № 47 Aorta: d=29 mm; Aortic valve: opening 21 mm; Left atrium: 40 mm; Mitral valve: S>4 cm2; left ventricle: KSR 33 mm, KDR 50 mm, FU 33%; Ejection fraction (Teicholz)=61%; Posterior wall: diast 11.2 mm, interventricular septum: diast 11.2 mm. Pulmonary artery: 19 mm; Right atrium: 37 mm; Right ventricle: KDR 27 mm, anterior wall: diast <5 mm. Conclusion: Initial manifestations of aortic atherosclerosis. Diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. Left ventricular hypertrophy.
24-hour ECG monitoring on December 13, 2011: during the observation period, sinus rhythm was recorded with a heart rate of 64 to 138 per minute. During wakefulness, tachycardia was recorded with an average hourly heart rate of 94 to 122 per minute. The decrease in heart rate at night is adequate. Average heart rate 96 (N to 85)/103/77 per minute. Registered single supraventricular extrasystoles (total 95), periodically paired. When performing the planned load (staircase test, 55 and 56 steps), the heart rate reached 116 and 125 per minute, the patient noted shortness of breath, palpitations. Ischemic changes in the ST segment were not detected.

     Certificate of incapacity for work: No.                  
     Clinical outcome (underline): recovery, improvement, no changes, chronicity, disability 
     Outcome: discharged due to improvement 
     
     Complaints at admission: moderate severe general weakness, sweating, thirst, dry mouth, shortness of breath and discomfort in the left half of the chest cell with moderate physical exertion, periodically headaches mainly in the occipital region against the background of an increase in blood pressure to 180/115 mm Hg, weight gain.
     Anamnesis of the disease: considers himself ill since 1999, when he first noted the appearance of a headache against the background of an increase in blood pressure to 160/110 mm Hg. Not treated. In 2003, during a hospital examination, hypertension of the second stage was diagnosed. The maximum figures for blood pressure are 220/120 mm Hg. He took enalapril, amlodipine with a temporary positive effect. Since 2008, the disease has acquired a crisis character with an episode of transient ischemic attack in the LSMA pool (November 30, 2010). Significant lability of blood pressure levels (130-220/80-120 mm Hg) over the past 5 years required frequent correction of antihypertensive therapy in stationary conditions with an increase in the doses of drugs taken (currently taking co-exforge 10/160/12, 5 mg, arterial hypertension at the level of mild arterial hypertension). Since 2007 began to notice episodes of palpitations, interruptions in the work of the heart. In 2009, a rhythm disorder was diagnosed according to the type of frequent ventricular extrasystole, against the background of taking antiarrhythmic drugs, extrasystole is less pronounced. Pain in the region of the heart during physical, psycho-emotional stress has been noted since 2007. Coronary heart disease has been diagnosed on a stationary basis, periodically taking kardiket, nitrospray. Since 2003, he has been experiencing an increase in blood glucose levels; he was hospitalized with type 2 diabetes mellitus; he took sorbifer without effect. Since 2010, he has been taking Siofor 850 mg 2 times a day, Protofan 36 units in the morning and 38 units in the evening, which allowed him to maintain a normal level of glycemia throughout the year. Over the past year, he began to notice an increase in blood glucose levels up to 15-16 mmol/l, he did not seek medical help. Independently increased the dose of Siofor taken to 1000 mg 2 times a day with little effect. An increase in microalbumin in the urine since 2007, at the same time, diabetic nephropathy was diagnosed. Increase in body weight for more than 20 years, during the last 3 years the weight is stable. Pain in the spine during physical exertion since 1997. He was treated on an outpatient and inpatient basis with a short-term positive effect. Pain in the epigastric region with an error in the diet since 1994, chronically diagnosed gastroduodenitis on an outpatient basis, occasionally taking Almagel, omeprazole with a positive effect. In May 2009, he was dismissed from the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for health reasons. Real deterioration: during the last three months, when, against the background of errors in the diet, he began to notice an increase in blood glucose levels up to 20 mmol / l (measured independently),
     Objective status at admission: general condition of moderate severity, due to decompensation of diabetes mellitus, the manifestation of which is diabetic ketosis. Hypersthenic constitution. Increased nutrition (BMI 40kg/m2). Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Heart rate 88 per minute, no deficit, rhythmic pulse, satisfactory properties. On auscultation, the heart sounds are muffled, the emphasis of the second tone is on the aorta, BP is 160/95 mm Hg, there is vesicular breathing in the lungs, no wheezing. The abdomen is soft, painless on palpation, the liver is along the edge of the costal arch, effleurage along the lumbar region is painless on both sides. Edema of the lower third of the legs and feet.
     Treatment was carried out: parenterally: after stopping ketosis in the ICU according to the standard scheme with the transition to the scheme Protofan HB 40 IU in the morning and 50 IU in the evening, Actrapid 40 IU before meals. Inside: aspirin 100 mg/day, galvusmet 150/1500 mg/day, Co-exforge 10/160/12.5. 
     As a result of the treatment, the state of health improved, blood glucose was within acceptable limits, cardiac pain syndrome did not recur, exercise tolerance was satisfactory, blood pressure was within normal values.

Left ventricular hypertrophy. Slight dilatation of the left chambers of the heart.
     24-hour ECG monitoring on 08/03/2013: during the observation period, sinus rhythm was recorded with a heart rate of 64 to 138 per minute. During wakefulness, the heart rate is from 64 to 122 per minute. The decrease in heart rate at night is adequate. Average heart rate 76/83/77 per minute. Frequent polytopic ventricular extrasystoles (895 in total), periodically paired, at 18:55 a single episode of unstable VT was registered (6 complexes). When performing the planned load (staircase test, 55 and 56 steps), the heart rate reached 116 and 125 per minute, the patient noted significant shortness of breath, palpitations. ST depression of the ischemic type was recorded against the background of physical activity, a total of 5 episodes, with a total duration of 42 minutes.
     Daily monitoring of blood pressure 05.08.2013 (against the background of therapy): mild stable arterial hypertension is recorded during the entire observation period with single rises in blood pressure (max. 182/124 mm Hg). Mean BP during the day 146/97 mmHg, mean BP at night 141/94 mmHg. 
     X-ray of the chest organs on August 08, 2013: on a survey radiograph in the lungs without infiltrative changes, the aorta was thickened. 
     Radiography of the lumbar spine on August 08, 2013: left-sided sacralization L5, spina bifida of the sacrum.

      Clinical outcome: improvement. 
      Outcome: discharged. 
      Upon enrolment:
       Complaints: discomfort in the lower part of the chest, general weakness, shortness of breath with previously tolerated physical exertion, cough with a moderate amount of discharge mixed with blood, episodic nausea, retching with streaks of blood.
       History of present illness. In 2012, due to the frequent detection of high blood pressure, its lability, and headaches, he underwent inpatient treatment at the military field therapy clinic (a copy of the medical history No. 56606 is pasted into this medical history). During hospitalization, the patient was diagnosed with the second stage of hypertension (AH 2, CV risk 3), atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary arteries, CHF 1 fc, chronic calculous cholecystitis, remission, osteochondrosis of the thoracic region with muscular tonic syndrome, obesity of the third degree. Regularly takes amlodipine, valsartan + hypothiazide, Plavix with a positive effect.
       Over the past year, I began to notice the frequent appearance of discomfort in the lower part of the chest on both sides, more on the left. From the beginning of October, after physical exertion (ascent to the 5th floor), attacks of nausea, vomiting of bile with episodes of blood streaks in it appeared, and general weakness began to increase. On October 18, 2013, after physical exertion (6-hour service), a sharp weakness developed, blackout in the eyes, followed by a short-term loss of consciousness. As he fell, he hit the corner of the table with his spatula. After this episode, there was a significant weakness, a cough with a bloody discharge (did not occur during the last three days). The presence of seizures denies. According to urgent indications, he was hospitalized in the city clinical hospital No. 40 (Sestroretsk), where, according to the patient, pulmonary embolism was ruled out and this condition was explained by the presence of an anomaly of the cervical vertebrae (copies of the examination results, including the result of a CT scan of the head and chest, are pasted into the present medical history, the discharge summary is not presented). Considering that his state of health does not allow him to properly perform his duties, he turned to the hospital therapy clinic, where, after examination, he was hospitalized to the clinic for further diagnosis and treatment.
       
      As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet No. 10, antiplatelet, antihypertensive, diuretic, metabolic, cardioprotective, mucolytic, antibacterial therapy, the state of health improved. The maximum possible compensation of the functions of internal organs and systems has been achieved.

      Outcome: discharged on improvement, discharged on recovery. 
      
      On admission: 
       Complaints of weakness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, local pain in the left side of the chest.
       The real worsening of the state of health came on the afternoon of 10/19/2014, when, while taking nitrospray for pain in the left side of the chest, the patient lost consciousness (the duration of the syncope is unknown). The patient refused the hospitalization offered by the emergency medical service team. Regularly takes phenobarbital for epilepsy (dose in the last day is unknown). On the morning of January 20, 2014 there was nausea, vomiting. Social transport delivered to the hospital therapy clinic VMedA. In the course of the survey, no convincing data were obtained for acute coronary syndrome (chest pain the day before and taking nitrospray for this reason) (chest pain was regarded as thoracalgia of non-cardiac origin). Loss of consciousness the day before, most likely due to orthostatic hypotension while taking nitrospray. Attention is drawn to the pronounced cerebral symptoms. The main severity of the condition at the time of hospitalization on 20.01.2014. caused cerebral symptoms, within which a differential diagnostic search was carried out between acute cerebrovascular accident in the vertebrobasilar basin and poisoning (overdose) of antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital). Taking into account the obtained MRI data (according to sito), the results of a toxicological blood test for barbiturates, the patient had toxic encephalopathy due to an overdose of barbiturates. In order to conduct detoxification therapy, the patient was urgently transferred, in agreement with the leadership of the department of military field therapy, to a specialized toxicological department of resuscitation and intensive care of the VPT clinic, where complex detoxification therapy was carried out. According to the stabilization of the state on 21.01.2014. at 18:30 she was again admitted to the hospital therapy clinic by transfer from the ICU. In the course of the examination, it was found that diseases of the internal organs are of a compensated nature and do not require additional correction of the therapy. Dominant in the picture of the disease is the pathology of the central nervous system, which does not require urgent medical intervention and the patient can undergo further treatment on an outpatient basis. that diseases of the internal organs are compensated and do not require additional correction of the therapy.

      History of present illness. Episodic headaches against the background of an increase in blood pressure have been a concern since 2000. In 2002, he was diagnosed with hypertension. Repeatedly passed inpatient treatment in the clinics of the Academy (VPT, Nervous diseases). Due to the ineffectiveness of the therapy, the appearance of edema and pain in the left foot, in 2007 he was examined inpatiently at the Clinic of Faculty Therapy of the Military Medical Academy, where he was diagnosed with an advanced metabolic syndrome ("Primary gout mixed variant. Acute gouty arthritis with damage to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot. Secondary osteoarthritis of the shoulder and knee joints FNS I. Hypertension stage II (AH 2, CVC risk 4) Atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary arteries, atherosclerotic cardiosclerosis without signs of heart failure. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, a sporadic variant, first identified. Obesity II degree, essential, stable phase. Diffuse non-toxic goiter of the 2nd degree, clinical euthyroidism. Fatty hepatosis 1 degree. Chronicdiscogenic radiculopathy with L4-L5 radicular syndrome on the left, with pain and muscular-tonic syndrome in remission). Since the same time, pronounced diffuse repolarization disorders have been detected on the ECG. In the future, against the background of constant neuropsychic overstrain, he noted an increase in the level of blood pressure, mainly diastolic, the appearance of edema of the legs and feet. In order to stabilize the condition, various combinations of medicines were used on an outpatient basis: Tarka, Prestarium, Arifon-retard, Amlodipine, Kordaflex ... However, all combinations were effective only for a short time after their administration, later there was a repeated increase in the level of diastolic blood pressure. He regularly took allopurinol 1-2 times a year for prophylactic purposes. Over the past year, against the background of constant neuropsychic overwork, he began to fall asleep with difficulty, independently used Morozov's drops, gradually increasing their dose to 5-10 ml before bedtime. With an increase in the level of diastolic blood pressure over 130 mm Hg. (during the first days of January 2012) began to notice pronounced pressing pains behind the sternum, independently took nitroglycerin with a positive effect.

      Anamnesis of the present disease (Anamnesis morbi): 
      Periodic aching pain in the epigastric region and heartburn after an error in nutrition has been noted since 2006, he did not seek medical help. FEGDS in 2007 verified chronic gastritis in the acute stage, was treated on an outpatient basis, took antacids with temporary improvement. In the future, abdominal pain syndrome recurred after errors in nutrition with a frequency of 2-3 times a year. He treated himself, took almagel with a good effect. Over the past year, abdominal pain has intensified and become more frequent.
      On October 11, 2011, FEGDS revealed multiple (two) ulcers of the duodenal bulb. He was treated permanently in the clinic of faculty therapy for newly diagnosed peptic ulcer. On the background of the therapy, scarring of ulcerative defects was achieved. In the future, he took antacid drugs for relapses of abdominal pain syndrome with temporary improvement. Deterioration of well-being a month after discharge, when, after a nutritional error, aching pains in the epigastric region, heartburn, "night" pains recurred, he took Almagel, Omez with little effect. On November 16, 2011, FEGDS revealed an ulcer of the duodenal bulb. In this connection, he underwent inpatient treatment at the FT clinic from 22.11 to 12.12.2011.
      Within a month after discharge, he felt satisfactorily, however, with a slight error in the diet, he noted the appearance of heartburn, sour eructation, which forced him to increase the dose of antacids taken on his own, and had a negative effect on the performance of official duties.

DISCLAIMER CASE 
HISTORY №, ARCHIVE №_________ 
Surname, name, patronymic: born in 1949 
She was hospitalized at the hospital therapy clinic
In total, 10 days of treatment were carried out 
. ICD Code M 17.9 MES 381020 
									          
Diagnosis: 
      Secondary nephropathy of mixed (atherosclerotic, hypertensive, nephritic) genesis. Chronic bilateral pyelonephritis, exacerbation phase. Cysts of the right kidney. Chronic kidney disease stage 4 (GFR 24 ml/h). Proteinuria. Chronic renal failure stage 1a. Neoplasm of both adrenal glands. 
      Arterial hypertension of mixed (essential, renoparenchymal) genesis of III degree → drug normotension, the risk of CVE is "very high". 
      Coronary artery disease. Atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary arteries. Atherosclerotic cardiosclerosis complicated by paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (without exacerbation).
      Heart failure II functional class 2a stage. 
       Bronchial asthma of mixed genesis (infection-dependent, primary altered bronchial reactivity) of moderate course, remission without respiratory failure. 
       Fixed hiatal hernia. Chronic atrophic gastritis, erosive bulbitis, exacerbation. 
       Alimentary-constitutional obesity of the 2nd degree (BMI-37.6 kg/m2), stable course. 

Certificate of incapacity for work: not issued 
Total radiation dose 1.4 mSv 
Clinical outcome: improvement. 
Outcome: discharged. 
      Upon enrolment:
      Complaints: frequent bouts of palpitations, increased blood pressure up to 190/150 mm Hg, episodic attacks of suffocation accompanied by wheezing, coughing with white bloody discharge, pain in the right hypochondrium and epigastric region with errors in diet.
      History of present illness. She suffered from chronic bronchitis for a long time. in 2011, the disease acquired a protracted course with frequent attacks of dyspnea, which prevented active seeking medical help. Bronchial asthma was verified on a stationary basis, adequate therapy was selected for outpatient admission (Seretide-multidisc 50/250 1 dose 1 time per day and berodual 2 doses 2 times a day). In the same year, she was operated on for urolithiasis on both sides, the stones were removed. In the postoperative period, she began to notice a significant increase in blood pressure, mainly due to diastolic blood pressure, palpitations, weakness, and her weight began to progressively increase (over the past 2 years, body weight has been stable). Takes diltiazem without visible effect.
      
     As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet No. 7, Seretide-multidisc, Berodual, Acecardol, Amlodipine, Omeprazole, Furosemide, Ciprofloxacin, the state of health improved.
      The patient was consulted by Professor Barsukov A.V. It has been determined that at present the course of concomitant diseases is of the maximum possible compensated character. The severity of the condition and the prognosis determine the functional state of the excretory function of the kidneys and the existing neoplasms of the adrenal glands, which make a significant contribution to the maintenance of arterial hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Despite the convincing effect of the prescribed therapy, it is recommended that the patient undergo an additional examination on an outpatient basis in order to determine the functional state of the adrenal glands, perform a blood test for catecholamines, plasma renin activity, aldosterone levels (after discontinuation of drugs that affect the RAAS system for 14 days) followed by a consultation nephrologist.

 11. Diet:
a. Limiting the intake of protein with food to up to 0.8-1 g / kg (up to 50-60 g per day), depending on the severity of renal failure. At the same time, 30 g should be a high-value protein, and only 10 g of protein per day should fall on the share of bread, cereals, potatoes and other vegetables. 30-40 g of complete protein. In general, the patient's menu is compiled within table No. 7. The following products are included in the patient's daily diet: meat (100-120 g), cottage cheese dishes, cereal dishes, semolina, rice, buckwheat, barley porridge. A potato and potato-egg diet is recommended. Particularly suitable due to the low protein content and at the same time high energy value are potato dishes (fritters, meatballs, grandmothers, fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, etc.), salads with sour cream, vinaigrettes with a significant amount (50-100 g) of vegetable oil. Tea or coffee can be acidified with lemon, put 2-3 tablespoons of sugar in a glass, it is recommended to use honey, jam, jam. Thus, the main composition of food is carbohydrates and fats and dosed - proteins. Calculating the daily amount of protein in the diet is a must. It is allowed to replace 1 egg with: cottage cheese - 40 g; meat - 35 g; fish - 50 g; milk - 160 g; cheese - 20 g; beef liver - 40 g.

Clinical outcome (underline): improvement 
Outcome: discharged on improvement 
Admission: 
Complaints: increasing dyspnea of ​​a mixed, mainly inspiratory nature, discomfort in the right side of the chest, paroxysmal cough without discharge, increasing weakness, decreased exercise tolerance.
Disease history. For a long time he suffers from coronary heart disease, hypertension. I have been drinking alcohol for a long time. In 2004, she suffered a massive myocardial infarction. 17.10.10 performed surgical treatment for bleeding (shock 2-3) from a chronic stomach ulcer. During the same hospitalization, decompensated diabetes mellitus was revealed. After discharge, she did not comply with the doctor's recommendations, she began to notice an increase in the volume of the abdomen. On this occasion, she was repeatedly hospitalized in the hospitals of the city, where complex treatment was performed with active diuretic therapy. The last hospitalization in the pulmonology department of City Hospital No. 26. After being discharged from the hospital, her condition deteriorated sharply. She was admitted to the hospital therapy clinic for urgent indications.
Objective status: general condition of moderate severity, edema of both legs to the hips, heart rate 60 per minute, no deficit, rhythmic pulse, auscultatory tones of the heart are muffled, the 1st tone is weakened above the apex of the heart, there is a rough systolic murmur at the apex, the boundaries of the heart are expanded , BP 115/70 mm Hg, hard breathing in the lungs, congestive rales in the lower lobe on the left, breathing is not heard on the right; the abdomen is enlarged due to the accumulation of free fluid, soft, painless on palpation, effleurage in the lumbar region is painless on both sides.
As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet No. 9, metabolic therapy (polarizing mixture: Sol.NaCl 0.9% -200.0, Sol.Asparcami 20 ml), vasodilators (Sol. Euphyllini 2.4% 10ml), inotropic therapy (Korglikon 0.06% 1.0 IV drip, Digoxin 0.00025 0.5 tab. in the morning), antibiotic therapy (Ciprofloxacin 0.5 1 tab. 2 times a day), diuretic therapy (Veroshpiron 0.025 tab. 1 tablet 4 times a day, Furosemide 1% 6.0 IV, Diuver 0.01 to 0.5 tablets 2 times a day, Hypothiazid 0.025 to 2 tablets in the morning), beta-adrenolytics (Betaloc-Zok 0, 05, 0.25 tab. 2 times a day), antithrombotic therapy (Aspicor 0.1, 1 tab. 1 time per day), punctures of the right pleural cavity (December 23, 24, 27, 9, 14 with evacuation of 2200 ml, 2500 ml, 2500 ml, 2550 ml straw-yellow liquid) feeling improved, shortness of breath decreased, cough regressed,edema in the legs and ascites disappeared, right-sided hydrothorax persisted, manifestations of heart failure decreased.
Taking into account the resistance of pathological exudation in the right pleural cavity to diuretic therapy and mechanical removal of fluid during pleural punctures, as well as taking into account the one-sidedness of the effusion (right pleural cavity), in further diagnosis, exclude a neoplasm of the right lung, mediastinum, and abdominal organs. 

The results of instrumental studies: 

ECG 23.12.2010, heart rate - 100 beats sinus rhythm, EOS to the right. Hypertrophy of the right ventricle. Widespread cicatricial changes in the anterior-septal, apical-lateral section of the left ventricle. Diffuse disorders of repolarization. Complete blockade of the right leg of the bundle of His.
ECG from 01/13/2011: sinus rhythm, heart rate 85 per minute. Violations of the processes of repolarization along the lower wall, rhythm disturbance in the form of frequent ventricular extrasystoles persist. 
Ultrasound of the abdominal organs on December 27, 2011: no ascites. Flatulence. Diffuse changes in the echostructure of the liver (according to the type of hepatosis). Ultrasound signs of circulatory failure. 
Ultrasound of the abdominal organs on 01/06/2011: compared to 12/27/2010 without dynamics. Hydrothorax on the right.

Outcome: discharged due to improvement
      
       Complaints: pressing pains behind the sternum that occur during physical exertion, sensations of interruptions in the work of the heart, episodes of palpitations, shortness of breath when climbing to the second floor, walking up to 200 meters, diffuse headache, dizziness with an increase in blood pressure up to 160/110 mm. rt. Art., working 130/80 mm. rt. Art., general weakness, fatigue, irritability, memory loss, sleep disturbance, periodic dry mouth and thirst, heartburn with errors in the diet.
       History of present illness. Since childhood, he often suffered from tonsillitis. In 1985, he was diagnosed with chronic tonsillitis, for which he was treated on an outpatient and inpatient basis. In 1995, after a sore throat, an infectious-allergic myocarditis developed, which proceeded with severe disturbances in heart rhythm and conduction. Subsequently, myocardial cardiosclerosis was formed with conduction disturbance in the form of a complete blockade of the right bundle branch of His, blockade of the anterior branch of the left bundle of His bundle. In the future, he was repeatedly treated for this in a hospital. Since 1999, she has been worried about shortness of breath during physical exertion; during a hospital examination, heart failure of the first functional class was verified. Since 2000, he has been worried about interruptions in the work of the heart, and frequent ventricular extrasystoles have been detected. Since 2004, pressing pains behind the sternum during physical exertion began to disturb, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris of the first functional class was diagnosed in a hospital, a constant intake of nitrates, antiplatelet agents was recommended, the patient partially fulfilled these recommendations. In August 2008, there was a hemodynamically significant paroxysm of ventricular tachycardia, stopped by electropulse therapy. In December 2008, coronary angiography was performed, in which angiographic signs of atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries were not detected. In April 2009, when performing an endocardial electrophysiological study of the heart, stable paroxysms of ventricular tachycardia were induced from the outflow tract of the right ventricle. In this regard, on April 15, 2009, a cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted. In the future, the patient continues to be disturbed by pressing pains in the chest and shortness of breath during physical exertion, interruptions in the work of the heart. As a result, he was repeatedly hospitalized. Headache against the background of episodes of increased blood pressure up to 150/100 mm Hg. Art. worried since 1986. Since 1995, he has been observed for neurocirculatory asthenia of the hypertensive type, occasionally taking antihypertensive drugs with a positive effect. Since 2004, an increase in blood pressure to 150/100 mm Hg. Art. takes a persistent character, at a hospital examination, hypertension of the first stage is diagnosed. In 2008, against the background of constant intake of antihypertensive drugs, there were rises in blood pressure up to 160/100 mm Hg. Art., stationary diagnosed with hypertension of the second stage, the initial manifestation of cerebrovascular insufficiency. In September 2011, he suffered a hypertensive crisis, stopped permanently. Since 2000, he has noted the appearance of episodic dry mouth, thirst, was observed due to impaired glucose tolerance. In 2003, during a hospital examination, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a mild course, was established. Until 2008, compensation was achieved by diet. Since 2008, hypoglycemic drugs have been added to the diet. In 2003, during a hospital examination, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a mild course, was established. Until 2008, compensation was achieved by diet. Since 2008, hypoglycemic drugs have been added to the diet. In 2003, during a hospital examination, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a mild course, was established. Until 2008, compensation was achieved by diet. Since 2008, hypoglycemic drugs have been added to the diet.
Currently taking Glibomet. Against this background, diabetes is compensated. In April 2009, a diffusely nodular goiter was detected without functional impairment. About fifteen years worried about heartburn with errors in the diet. Since 2003, chronic gastritis has been detected. In July 2009, the VVK was surveyed (a copy of the document is attached). In the course of this deterioration in health, he was hospitalized at the GT clinic of the Military Medical Academy for further examination and treatment.
      As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet N9 Sol. NaCl-200ml Sol. Espalipon 24.0 IV drip N5, T. Carvedilol 37.5 mg/day, T. Preductal 70 mg/day, T. Aspicor 100 mg/day, T. Atoris 20 mg/day, T. Ramipril 2.5 mg/day, T. Glibomet 1600 mg/day, T. Detralex, T. Vazobral, there is a positive trend: the pain syndrome did not recur, blood pressure is stabilized and corresponds to the target values ​​(normotension is maintained). He notes an increase in working capacity, an increase in tolerance to physical activity. Therapy for the outpatient stage of treatment was selected, recommendations were given.

    Anamnesis of the disease: Collection of anamnesis is difficult due to severe cognitive impairment. For a long time (more than 10 years) hypertension, coronary disease, noted cardiac arrhythmias. On this occasion, he is observed by a cardiologist at a polyclinic at the place of residence; he has repeatedly been treated and examined in cardiological hospitals. In 2000, he suffered a stroke, which was complicated by left-sided deep hemiparesis, hemihypesthesia (they still persist). The last hospitalization in a therapeutic hospital in August 2013 (clinic of faculty therapy of the Military Medical Academy), was diagnosed with: “CHD. Angina pectoris III FC. Atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary arteries. Atherosclerotic cardiosclerosis with arrhythmia according to the type of paroxysmal form of atrial fibrillation, conduction according to the type of AV blockade of the first degree. Hypertension stage III. CHF II-a stage, 2 FC. TsVB. Stage III DEP of mixed (post-stroke (2000), atherosclerotic) genesis in the form of left-sided deep hemiparesis, hemihypersthesia, cognitive impairment ”(copy of the discharge certificate in the medical history). The patient was discharged with improvement, the following therapy was recommended: losartan 12.5 mg/day, veroshpiron 50 mg/day, diuver 5 mg/day, pradaxa 220 mg/day, sotalol 40 mg/day. The regularity of taking drugs is observed (according to the patient). Deterioration of health has been noted since December 2013, shortness of breath has increased, edema of the lower extremities has appeared, lability of blood pressure levels, pains in the heart area, interruptions in the work of the heart, began to notice a decrease in exercise tolerance.
    According to the patient, in 2000 he was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis, subclinical hypothyroidism. On this occasion, it is observed by an endocrinologist. August 2013 - subclinical hypothyroidism; dose of L-thyroxine 25 mcg/day. In November 2013, thyroid status was monitored: T3, T4, TSH, and/tPO were normal values ​​(results on the hands), L-thyroxine was canceled by the endocrinologist.
    Objectively at the time of admission: the general condition is satisfactory. Consciousness is clear. The skin and visible mucous membranes are clean, dry, turgor is reduced. Limitation of motor activity of the left upper and lower extremities (left-sided hemiparesis due to previous ischemic stroke). The physique is correct, corresponds to age and sex. Normal nutrition: the thickness of the skin fold at the costal arch is 2 cm, near the navel 4 cm. The elasticity of the skin is reduced, slight acrocyanosis of the lips. Diagonal fold of the earlobe, senile arch of the eyes. There are no edema. The pulse is rhythmic, uniform, with a frequency of 80 beats. in min., BP 150 and 100 mm Hg. Heart sounds are muffled, rhythmic, accent II tone over the aorta, there is no pulse deficit. RR 17 per min. On auscultation over the lungs, breathing is vesicular, rales are not heard. The abdomen is soft, painless on palpation. A strengthened scar without signs of inflammation in the right iliac region is determined. The edge of the liver does not protrude from under the edge of the costal arch. The size of the liver according to Kurlov is 10*9*8 cm. The spleen is not palpable. Ragosa's symptom is negative. Tapping on the lumbar region is painless on both sides. There are no dysuric phenomena.
      Treatment was carried out: mode 3, diet 10. Parenterally: NaCl, KCl, glucose, cavinton, cordarone. Inside: blocktran, spironolactone, trigrium, pradaxa, sotohexal, sonizim, finasteride, phenazepam, phenibut, propafenone. In the form of ointments mycoseptin, troxevasin. 
      Against the background of ongoing therapy, hemodynamic parameters are stabilized within the optimal values. The patient notes a moderate improvement in general well-being, increased exercise tolerance.
      
      Repeatedly was on examination and treatment in therapeutic clinics of the Military Medical Academy and city medical institutions, diagnostically clear. Extreme hospitalization in August 2013 to the clinic of faculty therapy (a copy of the discharge summary on hand). Leading in the clinical picture is vascular pathology, represented by the consequences of ischemic stroke in the form of stage III dyscirculatory encephalopathy, left-sided hemiparesis, hemihypesthesia, and cognitive impairment; angina pectoris II-III functional classes, arterial hypertension with moderate symptoms of chronic heart failure, rare paroxysms of atrial fibrillation.

      The goals of therapy were achieved: manifestations of chronic heart failure, congestive pneumonia were stopped, the maximum possible compensation of the function of internal organs was achieved at this stage. organs and systems, the genesis of pronounced congestion was determined, and therapy was selected for the initial stage of outpatient treatment. In a satisfactory condition, he is discharged to the polyclinic at the place of residence under the supervision of specialist doctors. 
      
Recommended: 
 15. Lifelong dispensary supervision of a nephrologist, endocrinologist, cardiologist at the place of residence.
 16. Control study (at least once every 3 months): ECG, general blood and urine tests, blood tests for cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, creatinine, potassium, urea, glucose. 
 17. Determination of blood levels of T3, T4, antibodies to thyroglobulin, cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone - 2 times a year, followed by correction based on the results of the dose of levothyroxine 
 18. Continuous monitoring of body weight !!! with an increase in body weight of more than 1 kg (in comparison with the discharge data), consultation with a cardiologist in order to exclude the worsening of the course of chronic heart failure and correct (if necessary) the therapy.
 19. Diet: restriction of protein intake with food to 0.8-1 g / kg (up to 50-60 g per day), depending on the severity of renal failure. At the same time, 30 g should be a high-value protein, and only 10 g of protein per day should fall on the share of bread, cereals, potatoes and other vegetables. 30-40 g of complete protein. In general, the patient's menu is compiled within table No. 7. The following products are included in the patient's daily diet: meat (100-120 g), cottage cheese dishes, cereal dishes, semolina, rice, buckwheat, barley porridge. A potato and potato-egg diet is recommended. Particularly suitable due to their low protein content and at the same time high energy value are potato dishes (pancakes, meatballs, grandmothers, fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, etc.), salads with sour cream, vinaigrettes with a significant amount (50-100 g) of vegetable oil. Tea or coffee can be acidified with lemon, put 2-3 tablespoons of sugar in a glass, it is recommended to use honey, jam, jam. Thus, the main composition of food is carbohydrates and fats and dosed - proteins. Calculating the daily amount of protein in the diet is a must. It is allowed to replace 1 egg with: cottage cheese - 40 g; meat - 35 g; fish - 50 g; milk - 160 g; cheese - 20 g; beef liver - 40 g.
      Approximate diet: 
• Breakfast: Soft-boiled egg + Rice porridge 60 g + Honey 50 g 
• Lunch: Fresh cabbage soup 300 g + Fried fish with mashed potatoes 150 g + Apples 
• Dinner: Mashed potatoes 300 g + Vegetable salad 200 g + Milk 200 d 
      Correction of water balance disorders: take enough liquid to maintain diuresis in the range of 1.5-2.0 liters per day. 
      Correction of electrolyte imbalance: salt intake should be limited to 5 g per day 
 20. Continue taking: 
• Amlodipine 5 mg - 1 tab. in the morning constantly; 
• Carvedilol 12.5 mg - ½ tab. 2 times a day; 
• Torasemide (Diuver) 10 mg - 1 tab. in the morning;

Art. (normal value of blood pressure 130/80 mm. rdest.) for interruptions in the work of the heart; memory loss, sleep disturbance; to increase urination; weakness in the lower extremities; pain in the thoracic and lumbar spine: pain in the left knee joint.
      Anamnesis of the disease: Since 1990, pain in the region of the heart has been disturbing, IHD has been diagnosed on an outpatient basis, angina pectoris I f. class In 1992, a paroxysm of atrial fibrillation developed, which was stopped by the introduction of novocainamide. Subsequently, paroxysms of atrial fibrillation regularly recurred, stopped on their own, took verapamil with panagin, in the absence of effect, an ambulance brigade was called. Headaches with increased blood pressure appear since 1995, took ACE inhibitors. In the future, he was repeatedly treated in a hospital with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, angina pectoris II f. class, rhythm disturbance by type of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Hypertension II stage. NC I Art. For more than 20 years he has been suffering from chronic gastroduodenitis, EGDS - in the spring of 2004. For fifteen years he has been suffering from intervertebral osteochondrosis and deforming spondylosis of the cervical and lumbar spine, and has been treated on an outpatient basis and in sanatoriums. After a business trip to Antarctica, numbness and blanching of the fingers in the cold are disturbing. Angiosurgeon diagnosed angiotrophoneurosis of the upper extremities, was treated on an outpatient basis, took courses of vascular drugs. For 7 years, she has noted a significant deterioration in memory, sleep disturbance, increased dizziness, unsteady gait, a neurologist diagnosed dyscirculatory encephalopathy, and takes nootropic drugs. Diagnosed with hemorrhoids for 25 years, for 5 years - frequent bleeding from hemorrhoids, in October 2004 operated on - excision of hemorrhoids. After surgical treatment, body weight decreased by 10 kg. In the spring of 2004, the FCS was performed, no neoplasms. In 2002, he was examined by the VVK, recognized as partially fit for military service. In 2003 and 2004, a limitation of the ability to work was revealed, certified by MSEK: IHD. Angina pectoris III f. class Atherosclerosis of the aorta, coronary and cerebral arteries, atherosclerotic cardiosclerosis with rhythm disturbances by the type of paroxysmal tachysystolic atrial fibrillation.

      History of present illness. At the age of 6 months, due to the developed complex (thin-thin) ileocolic intussusception, the operation of resection of the ileocecal angle with anastomosis of the small intestine to the side of the large intestine (submersible anastomosis) was performed. In the future, she often noted pain in the abdomen. In 1994, she was hospitalized for chronic gastroduodenitis. During the second pregnancy (5 years ago), she significantly gained body weight (since then her body weight has been stable) up to 94 kg, varicose veins of the lower extremities appeared and she began to notice the appearance of discomfort in the right iliac region, stool instability, bloating, excessive gas formation. In 2007, she independently identified the node of the inner quadrant of the left breast, was consulted by a mammologist at the regional hospital (fibrocystic mastopathy). In June 2013, she was consulted on an outpatient basis by a gastroenterologist (on FGDS there were signs of gastroduodenitis), a course of therapy was recommended, which included platifilin s / c, pariet, duspatalin, drip administration of drugs (analgin, papaverine) with a positive effect. In August 2013, while on vacation (Greece), she began to notice significant swelling of the feet and legs, heartburn, and “bitterness” in her mouth. Taking into account that the state of health does not allow to properly perform official duties, she was routinely hospitalized to the hospital therapy clinic for diagnosis and treatment. while on vacation (Greece), she began to notice significant swelling of the feet and legs, heartburn, and “bitterness” in her mouth.

      Results of instrumental studies:
       UZDG from 06/04/2010: the blood flow has the features of the main one, without signs of AVM and local stenosis, without pathological overflows. LBF in all located arteries is within acceptable limits, without significant asymmetry. The range of cerebrovascular reactivity was preserved in full. 
       MRI of the brain dated 04.06.2010: Conclusion: MRI signs of the initial manifestations of dyscirculatory encephalopathy, uneven expansion of the subarachnoid space. 
       ECG from. 06/03/2010: sinus rhythm with heart rate = 88 in 1 min., horizontal EOS. Incomplete blockade of the right leg of the bundle of His. The predominance of the potentials of the left ventricle.
       ECHO-KG dated 06/03/2010: MZHP-12mm, ZS-11mm, KDRLZh-51mm, KSRLZh-34mm, FV-62%, FU-34%, UO-77ml, LP-40×40×50mm, PP-38 ×47mm, RV-25mm, E/A=1.1 IMMlzh-142g/m2 Myocardium is symmetrically thickened. The kinetics is not broken. The cavities are free, not dilated, the valves are not changed, there is valvular regurgitation on the pulmonic valve. The aorta is sealed. The pericardium is intact. 
       VEM dated 06/01/2010: functional class - 2. The VEM test was carried out against the background of antihypertensive therapy. The test is negative (no signs of coronary circulation disorders were detected). Load tolerance is average. BP response is adequate.
       24-hour ECG monitoring from May 31, 2010: during monitoring, sinus rhythm was recorded with a heart rate of 47 to 170 per minute. The decrease in heart rate at night is adequate. Average heart rate 84/85/62 per minute. Registered single ventricular extrasystoles (2); solitary supraventricular, periodically frequent (from 13:00 to 14:00 - 103 extrasystoles; from 15:00 to 17:00 - 101 extrasystoles; in total 263 per day), with episodes of the type of bi- and trigeminia. At 21:25, a single episode of transient 2nd degree type 2 AV blockade (Mobitz 2) was registered with a pause of 2 seconds. When performing the planned load, the heart rate reached 166 and 170 in 1 minute, subjectively noted the heartbeat. Ischemic changes in the ST segment were not detected.
       24-hour blood pressure monitoring from May 31, 2010: the study was performed against the background of antihypertensive therapy (amlodipine, enalapril). Mean systolic BP in the daytime is typical for mild labile hypertension, at night the average systolic BP is within the normal range. Mean diastolic BP during the day is typical for mild stable hypertension, at night - for moderate stable hypertension. At night, systolic and diastolic blood pressure fall adequately (dipper).

In 2004, she suffered a massive myocardial infarction. 17.10.10 performed surgical treatment for bleeding (shock 2-3) from a chronic stomach ulcer. During the same hospitalization, decompensated diabetes mellitus was diagnosed. After discharge, she did not comply with the doctor's recommendations, she began to notice an increase in the volume of the abdomen. On this occasion, she was repeatedly hospitalized in the hospitals of the city, where complex treatment was performed with active diuretic therapy. After discharge from the pulmonology department of City Hospital No. 26, his condition deteriorated sharply. From December 23, 2010 to January 14, 2011, she was treated at the GT VMedA clinic. In view of the resistance of pathological exudation in the right pleural cavity to diuretic therapy and mechanical removal of fluid during pleural punctures, in the diagnosis, the patient was recommended to perform a CT scan in order to exclude a neoplasm of the right lung, mediastinum, and abdominal organs. When trying to perform tomography, the study turned out to be uninformative, according to the patient, due to the presence of fluid in the pleural cavity. During the last week, she began to notice an increase in dyspnea, its occurrence at rest. In this connection, she was taken by an ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic for urgent indications. When trying to perform tomography, the study turned out to be uninformative, according to the patient, due to the presence of fluid in the pleural cavity. During the last week, she began to notice an increase in dyspnea, its occurrence at rest. In this connection, she was taken by an ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic for urgent indications.

During the last week, she began to notice an increase in dyspnea, its occurrence at rest. In this connection, she was taken by an ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic for urgent indications.
Objective status: general condition of moderate severity, swelling of the feet, legs, heart rate 90 per minute, no deficit, rhythmic pulse, auscultatory tones of the heart are muffled, the 1st tone is weakened above the apex of the heart, there is a rough systolic murmur at the apex, the boundaries of the heart are expanded, BP 110/60 mm Hg in the lungs, hard breathing, single congestive rales in the lower lobe on the left, on the right, breathing is not heard in the zone of dullness from the level of the 5th rib; the abdomen is not enlarged, soft, painless on palpation, the edge of the liver protrudes 4 cm from under the costal arch, effleurage in the lumbar region is painless on both sides.
As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet No. 9, metabolic therapy (polarizing mixture: Sol.NaCl 0.9% -200.0, Sol.Asparcami 20 ml), inotropic therapy (Korglikon 0.06% 1.0 i.v. drip, Digoxin 0.00025, 0.5 tablets in the morning), hypoglycemic therapy (Maninil 0.0035, 2 tablets per day), antibacterial therapy (Augmentin, 1 tablet 2 times a day), diuretic therapy (Diuver 0.01 1 tab per day, Hypothiazid 0.025, 2 tab. in the morning), beta-adrenolytics (Betaloc-Zok 0.05, 0.25 tab. 2 times a day), antithrombotic therapy (Acecardol 0.1, 1 tab. 1 time per day), hepatoprotective therapy (Essentiale 5.0 No. 5 IV), punctures of the right pleural cavity (January 27, 31, February 07 with evacuation of 2700 ml, 1500 ml, 2000 ml of straw-yellow liquid, subsequent administration of 80 mg of gentamicin intrapleurally), the state of health improved, shortness of breath decreased,cough regressed, edema in the legs disappeared, a small amount of fluid remained in the supraphrenic parts of the right lung.
     Taking into account the resistance of pathological exudation in the right pleural cavity to diuretic therapy and mechanical removal of fluid during pleural punctures, as well as taking into account the one-sidedness of the effusion (right pleural cavity), further diagnosis should still exclude a neoplasm (pleural mesothelioma? 
     ) it is impractical, since this manipulation requires one-lung ventilation of the lungs - the patient will not tolerate this intervention due to functional disorders. 
     Data for tuberculosis were not received. 

Results of instrumental studies:

ECG 02/27/2011, heart rate - 91 per minute Sinus rhythm, EOS to the right. Cicatricial changes in the anterior-septal, apical-lateral section of the left ventricle.

      This block includes a number of mental disorders grouped together on the basis of the presence of clear etiological factors, namely, the cause of these disorders was brain disease, brain injury or stroke, leading to cerebral dysfunction. Dysfunction can be primary (as in diseases, brain injuries and strokes that directly or selectively affect the brain) and secondary (as in systemic diseases or disorders when the brain is involved in the pathological process along with other organs and systems).
      Dementia [dementia] (F00-F03) is a syndrome caused by damage to the brain (usually chronic or progressive) in which many higher cortical functions are impaired, including memory, thinking, orientation, understanding, counting, learning ability, speech and judgment. Consciousness is not obscured. Cognitive decline is usually accompanied, and sometimes preceded, by deterioration in control of emotions, social behavior, or motivation. This syndrome is noted in Alzheimer's disease, in cerebrovascular diseases, and in other conditions that primarily or secondarily affect the brain. 
      If necessary, an additional code is used to identify the underlying disease.

      She was admitted to the clinic for urgent indications with complaints of dull diffuse headache, dizziness, rise in blood pressure to 170/100 mm Hg, chest discomfort with irradiation to the left arm with little physical exertion, shortness of breath, palpitations; heartburn, belching sour, nausea, vomiting; soreness in the shoulder, knee, ankle, small joints of the hands and feet, itching of the skin of the face, hands, forearms, hyperemia of the back and wings of the nose, swelling of the face in the morning; weight gain, general weakness; internal discomfort and feeling of lack of air mainly at night; dull aching pain in the lumbar region.
       	Anamnesis morbi: She fell ill acutely in November 2005, when, against the background of relative well-being, severe morning stiffness, soreness, redness and swelling appeared in the area of ​​small joints of both hands, shoulder, elbow and knee joints, fever up to 400C, sweating, severe general weakness, rapid fatigue. On November 14, she was examined by a general practitioner, and a course of anti-inflammatory therapy (diclofenac retard, prednisone 30 mg/day) was prescribed, which resulted in a significant improvement in her state of health. Due to the deterioration of her condition in January 2006, she was hospitalized at military unit 25515 with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, seropositive, articular form. She received cytostatic therapy with methotrexate, mini-pulse therapy with methylprednisolone, movalis, physiotherapy with a positive effect. Subsequently, against the background of outpatient cytostatic therapy (methotrexate 7.5 mg/week, prednisolone 10 mg/day), she felt satisfactory for the next three months. In May 2006, against the background of constant use of methotrexate, prednisolone and washing, pain, heaviness in the epigastric region and nausea after taking medications, in the left and right hypochondria, appeared, and therefore she independently refused to take medications. Against the background of refusal of treatment, the pain in the joints intensified, pains in the right elbow joint joined, subfibrile fever appeared. She resumed taking medications again without a positive effect. 26.06.06 for urgent indications, she was hospitalized in the rheumatology department of the NLMK Medical Unit, where she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus for the first time. Received treatment: methotrexate 10 mg/week, prednisolone 20 mg/day, movalis, chimes, pentoxifylline, physiotherapy with a positive effect. However, against the background of constant intake of these drugs, at the end of October 2006, pain in the joints increased again, there was hyperemia of the back of the nose and cheeks, itching of the skin of the face, hands, swelling on the face and hands, periodic pain behind the sternum and in the left half of the chest, palpitations, shortness of breath with little physical exertion, general weakness, pain in the mouth, nagging pain in the lumbar region after physical exertion and a decrease in the dose of prednisolone taken. Stationary held a course of plasmapheresis and plasmasorption, pulse therapy with methylprednisolone. After this course of therapy in the next 6 months, while taking 10 mg of prednisolone and 7.5 mg of methotrexate, she felt well. Exacerbations of the disease were noted in October-November 2007 and February-March 2007 and 2008, however, an increase in the dose of prednisolone to 80 mg/day for 3 weeks, followed by a gradual decrease in the dose to 15-40 mg/day, made it possible to stop exacerbations. Annually, she underwent planned inpatient treatment for the underlying disease, where the dose of medications taken was adjusted.
	The last exacerbation of the disease was noted in September 2008. In the day hospital regimen, treatment was carried out: regimen, diet, intravenously: pulse therapy "Solu-medrol" 1000 mg (18.09.08 and 19.09.2008), asparkam, cardionate, cytoflavin and riboxin No. 5, neoton 4g No. 2, vitamins: C, B1, trental No. 3, cerebrolysin No. 1, piracetam No. 3, prednisolone 40 mg in the morning, methotrexate 10 mg / week. After the therapy, there was a short-term improvement in well-being, however, from mid-October, the condition progressively worsened in the form of discomfort behind the sternum with irradiation to the left arm and shortness of breath with little physical exertion (rise to the 1st floor), palpitations, heartburn, sour belching, nausea, pain in the chest. shoulder, knee, ankle, small joints of the hands, feet, swelling of the face in the morning, general weakness, internal discomfort and itching of the skin of the face, forearms, hands, as well as a feeling of lack of air mainly at night, hyperemia of the back and wings of the nose. An increase in the dose of methotrexate taken up to 15 mg/week and prednisolone up to 40 mg/day did not lead to the desired result. The existing complaints, despite taking omeprazole and almagel for the purpose of gastroprotection, were accompanied by pain in the epigastric region, heartburn, sour belching, nausea, episodic vomiting after taking medications, progressively increasing general weakness, numbness in the fingers and toes. On an outpatient basis in the clinic in the general blood test, signs of a mild degree of normochromic anemia were revealed, laboratory data for the activity of the process (increased ESR, CRP) were not noted, and therefore hospitalization in the rheumatology department was recommended in a planned manner. brushes, as well as a feeling of lack of air mainly at night, hyperemia of the back and wings of the nose.

	Over the past two years, he has noted an increase in blood pressure up to 170/110 mmHg, accompanied by dizziness, nausea, and palpitations. He takes antihypertensive drugs regularly (noliprel 2 mg in the morning). For the first time, systolic murmur over the apex of the heart appeared in 2006, with time its intensity increased. Episodic pain in the epigastric region notes for ten years, was treated independently with a temporary positive effect. During the last two years, she notes unsteadiness when walking, numbness in the fingers of the upper limbs, she was not treated, she did not seek medical help.
	Around 5:00 p.m. on November 17, 2008. I woke up with an unbearable headache and nausea. There was a single vomiting of food eaten the day before. Given the increase in blood pressure to 170/100 mm Hg. self-administered captopril 50 mg po, nifedipine 10 mg po without effect. Given the appearance of flies before the eyes, severe heaviness in the head, nausea, weakness caused an ambulance. She was taken to the VMA Hospital Therapy Clinic for further diagnosis and treatment.

Technical commentary on the study 11/15/2006:
Antibodies to the common extractable nuclear antigen of antibodies to the 60 kDa SS-A antigen have been found Antibodies to the 60 kDa Ro/SS-A antigen are relatively more frequently detected in patients with SLE than in those with Sjogren's syndrome and skin forms. Antibodies to the 60 kDa Ro/SS-A antigen are relatively more frequently detected in patients with SLE than in Sjogren's syndrome and cutaneous lesions, secondary dry syndrome, photosensitivity, and articular syndrome. A dangerous manifestation of SLE associated with antibodies against Ro / SS-A 60 kDa is the syndrome of congenital lupus, which develops in newborns from parturient women with SLE. This disease is based on the penetration of antibodies to Ro/SS-A into the blood of the newborn through the placenta. The main manifestation of congenital lupus is dermatosis and lesions of internal organs, including congenital transverse AV blockade, hepatitis, hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Antibodies to dsDNA are the main serological marker of SLE with kidney damage, since they are involved in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis, in addition, they are included in the 10th criterion of SLE. Low titers of anti-DNA antibodies without concomitant ANF and antibodies to an extractable nuclear antigen can be observed against the background of viral and infectious diseases and, if isolated, are not a sign of SLE. There is a correlation between the increase in titers of antinuclear factor (ANF), antibodies to dsDNA and hypocomplementemia before the development of an exacerbation of SLE, which requires periodic determination of titers of antibodies to dsDNA and the level of complement factors C3 and C4 in all patients with SLE with a frequency of once every 3-6 months.

	Clinical outcome: improvement 
      Outcome: discharged on improvement,
      Complaints: on the growing pronounced general weakness, decreased exercise tolerance, an increase in the abdomen in volume, shortness of breath of a mixed, mainly inspiratory nature.
      History of present illness. For a long time he suffers from coronary heart disease, hypertension. In 2006, she suffered a massive myocardial infarction. On October 17, 2010, surgical treatment was performed for bleeding (shock 2-3) from a chronic stomach ulcer. During the same hospitalization, decompensated diabetes mellitus was revealed. After discharge, she did not comply with the doctor's recommendations, she began to notice an increase in the volume of the abdomen. On this occasion, she was repeatedly hospitalized in the hospitals of the city, where complex treatment was performed with active diuretic therapy. The last hospitalization in the pulmonology department of City Hospital No. 26. After discharge from the hospital on December 14, 2010, she began to notice a sharp increase in dyspnea at rest, the appearance of a cough without discharge, and an increase in general weakness. On December 23, 2010, she was admitted to the hospital therapy clinic. After discharge, he feels well for 2 weeks, but later on there is a progressive increase in the feeling of weakness, shortness of breath, which requires re-hospitalization. In February, March and April 2011, for the reasons described above, she underwent inpatient treatment, where punctures of the pleural cavity and evacuation of the contents were performed. In June 2011, she was hospitalized in order to exclude a neoplasm (mesothelioma) at the Federal State Institution “Research Institute of Oncology named after N.N. N.N. Petrov” of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation, where after a comprehensive examination, including pleural biopsy and thoracoscopy, no data for the neoplasm were obtained. Diagnosed with idiopathic right-sided hydrothorax, ischemic cardiomyopathy. Subsequently, she underwent inpatient treatment at the Regional Cardiological Dispensary of the Leningrad Region. After release, within 2 months she felt satisfactory, however, in the future, due to progressive weakness on an outpatient basis, at least 2,000 ml of fluid was evacuated monthly during punctures of the right pleural cavity. During hospitalization in March 2012, during the drainage of the pleural cavity from March 5 to March 8, about 6000 ml of hemorrhagic exudate was obtained, a drop in hemoglobin from 144 to 80 g/l was noted, which was the reason for transfer to a surgical hospital, where data for ongoing intrapleural bleeding was not received, received conservative therapy, terilitin therapy. Discharged with subfebrile fever. Due to the deterioration of health in May 2012 in the form of severe fever, pain in the right half of the chest, she was hospitalized in the hospital surgery clinic, where she underwent inpatient treatment for pleural empyema on the right. After discharge, she felt relatively well. October 2012 general weakness began to progressively increase again, tolerance to physical activity sharply decreased, and the stomach increased in volume. She underwent inpatient treatment in the hospital therapy clinic with a positive effect. During the year, there was a slow progression of ascitic phenomena, which by November 2013. acquired a pronounced decompensated character and required another hospitalization. She was hospitalized by an ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic for further diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis at discharge: “Chronic viral hepatitis B, cirrhotic stage (Child-Pugh class B). Fibrosis of the liver of mixed (cardiac, dysmetabolic) genesis. Chronic hepatocellular insufficiency of the 1st stage, compensation. Portal hypertension syndrome, ascites. Hepatosplenomegaly. IHD: stable angina pectoris 3 functional class. Atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary arteries, atherosclerotic and postinfarction (2004) cardiosclerosis. Secondary ischemic cardiomyopathy. Chronic aneurysm of the apex of the left ventricle. CHF 2B stage, III functional class. Middle fibrothorax on the right. Chronic decompensated pulmonary heart of mixed (broncho-pulmonary, vascular, thoraco-diaphragmatic) genesis. Secondary severe pulmonary hypertension. DN 1st. Hypertensive disease of the third stage, drug normotension, the risk of CVE is extremely high. Chronic pyelonephritis, latent course, remission. Mixed nephropathy (atherosclerotic, dysmetabolic, diabetic, hypertonic) genesis. CKD stage C3b (GFR=44ml/min). HPN-1a. Dyscirculatory encephalopathy of the second stage of mixed (hypertonic, atherosclerotic, dysmetabolic) genesis. Degenerative-dystrophic disease of the spine. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, target HbAc<8.0%.” During hospitalization, there was a pronounced tolerance to the ongoing complex diuretic therapy in high doses. After discharge from the hospital, she was under dispensary dynamic supervision of a polyclinic doctor at her place of residence, she did not take the recommended therapy. There was a progressive increase in body weight, during the last month there was a pronounced general weakness, an increase in the volume of the abdomen, shortness of breath of a mixed, mainly inspiratory, nature with previously tolerated exercise tolerance.

      Complaints: headaches mainly in the occipital region of the head, episodic dizziness, absent-mindedness after psycho-emotional stress; fast fatigue; decrease in performance.
      Medical history: Episodic headaches against the background of high blood pressure have been noted since 2007, but he did not seek medical help due to fear of being dismissed from military service. Upon admission to the VATT in 2008, the VVK was diagnosed as “healthy”. After admission, against the background of increased psycho-emotional stress, headaches became more frequent. On the recommendation of friends, he began to periodically measure blood pressure, while he noted a stable increase in blood pressure at the level of 140/100 mm Hg. Art. with periodic increases up to 170/100 mm Hg. In 2009, due to a significant increase in blood pressure (220/140 mmHg), he was hospitalized in 17 m / o 442 OVKG from February 18 to March 10, 2009, with a diagnosis of "Hypertension of the first stage (borderline). Hypertensive crisis from 17.02.2009, stopped with medication” (discharge summary No. 3434). After discharge, he does not take regular therapy. Occasionally, with an increase in blood pressure over 150/100 mm Hg. independently takes captopril with a moderate effect (“working” blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg).
       A real deterioration in well-being over the past month, when rapid fatigue began to appear with previously tolerated physical exertion, with psychoemotional stress, frequent rises in blood pressure up to 190/110 mm Hg began to be noted, headaches with nausea developed, which required additional intake of antihypertensive drugs. funds (captopril up to 100 mg under the tongue). 
       Independently applied to the medical service 104 CDC, from where, given the inadequacy of the self-treatment, he was sent for hospitalization in order to diagnose and select adequate therapy.

The kinetics is not broken. The cavities are not dilated, the cavities are free in the visible areas. The aorta is slightly locally compacted. Systolic function is not broken. Diastolic dysfunction of the rigid type. Regurgitation applied to the MK and TK. Pulmonary blood flow is not changed. The pericardium is intact.
       Ultrasound of the abdominal organs No. 903 dated 06/03/2011: the liver is slightly enlarged, the right lobe: 14 cm; left 9.0 cm, smooth contours, homogeneous structure, increased echogenicity; intrahepatic vessels are not dilated; portal vein 10 mm, hepatic veins 8 mm (up to 10 mm). Intrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated. Distal attenuation of the ECHO signal. The gallbladder is reduced after eating, stones are not visualized. The pancreas is located indistinctly, not enlarged, the contours are clear, even, the structure is heterogeneous, echogenicity is increased; Wirsung's duct is not dilated. The kidneys are of normal size (right 11×4.8 cm, left 11×5.3 cm), normal location, with even contours, homogeneous parenchyma 18-22 mm thick, cavitary systems are not dilated. The spleen is 10×5.4 cm in size, not enlarged. In the projection of the location of the adrenal glands, no pathological formations were found. Conclusion: examination after eating, moderate hepatomegaly.
      24-hour monitoring of ECG and blood pressure according to Holter against the background of selected therapy ID:L6602 dated 06/07/2011: during the observation period, sinus rhythm was recorded with a heart rate of 55 to 163 per 1 minute, a decrease in heart rate at night is sufficient. Average heart rate 85/91/74 in 1 minute. Single supraventricular extrasystoles were registered (23 in total). When performing the planned load (staircase test, 180 steps), the heart rate reached 163 in 1 minute, while palpitations, shortness of breath, and weakness in the legs were subjectively noted. Ischemic changes in the ST segment were not detected.
      Average systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the daytime, their variability during the day within acceptable limits. Mean systolic BP at night is characteristic of mild stable hypertension, mean diastolic BP at night is characteristic of moderate stable hypertension. 
      At night, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure decrease insufficiently (nondipper). Episodes of hypotension were not registered. There is an increase in the rate of the morning rise in systolic blood pressure 
      . Plain radiograph of the chest No. 1665 dated 06/02/11: in the lungs without focal and infiltrative changes. The heart is not enlarged.

      Complaints: pressing and constricting pain behind the sternum, shortness of breath, mainly of an inspiratory nature, arising from slight physical exertion (walking 50-70 m or climbing 10 steps), stopped by rest for 5 minutes. or taking nitroglycerin; increase in blood pressure up to 180/125 mm. rt. Art., accompanied by a dull headache without a clear localization; discomfort in the left half of the chest against the background of a feeling of interruptions in the work of the heart, moderate general weakness, increased fatigue; memory loss.
     
     Anamnesis of the disease: For a long time suffers from ischemic disease and hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus. Repeatedly underwent inpatient treatment in various hospitals of the city. The last hospitalization was in March 2010 in the 26th hospital in St. Petersburg with a diagnosis of progressive angina pectoris (medical documentation not provided). Regularly takes: amlodipine 10+5 mg/day, sotalol 80+40 mg/day, hypothiazide 25 mg/day, diroton 5 mg in the evening, cordarone 100 mg/day, preductal 2+2 tab/day, diabetone MV 30 mg in the morning and siofor 500 mg in the evening. Against the background of ongoing therapy, hemodynamics is stable at the "target" level of blood pressure 130-140/60-70 mm Hg, pulse 56-66 per minute. Over the past 2 weeks, she began to occasionally notice paroxysms of a feeling of palpitations with interruptions in the work of the heart that occur acutely against the background of relative well-being, lasting up to 6 hours, stopping on their own or after taking 400 mg of cordarone. During the last 10 days, she began to notice the occurrence of angina attacks with previously tolerated physical exertion, which required the use of nitroglycerin more often than usual. Given the ineffectiveness of self-administered therapy, she called an ambulance team, which was hospitalized in the ICU of the hospital therapy clinic.

       Complaints at admission: pronounced palpitations, "lump in the throat", pronounced weakness, pressing pain in the region of the heart, pain in the shoulder, knee and small joints of the hands, their stiffness in the morning for 2 hours, swelling of the face in the morning, internal discomfort, itching of the skin of the face, episodic sharp chilliness in the fingers and toes; nausea when taking medications, heaviness in the epigastric region when eating; weight loss within 4 months by 10 kg. 
       
Disease history:
       She fell ill acutely in November 2005, when, against the background of relative well-being, severe morning stiffness, soreness, redness and swelling appeared in the area of ​​small joints of both hands, shoulder, elbow and knee joints, fever up to 400C, sweating, severe general weakness, and rapid fatigue. On November 14, she was examined by a general practitioner, and a course of anti-inflammatory therapy (diclofenac retard, prednisone 30 mg/day) was prescribed, which resulted in a significant improvement in her state of health. She underwent inpatient treatment at military unit 25515 with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, seropositive, articular form. She received cytostatic therapy, mini-pulse therapy with methylprednisolone, movalis, physiotherapy with a positive effect. In the future, against the background of outpatient cytostatic therapy (methotrexate 7.5 mg/week, prednisolone 10 mg/day), pain, heaviness in the epigastrium, left and right hypochondria appeared, and therefore in May 2006 she independently refused to take medications. Against the background of refusal of treatment, the pain in the joints intensified, pains in the right elbow joint joined. She resumed taking medications again without a positive effect.
       26.06.06 was hospitalized in the rheumatology department of the NLMK Medical Unit, where she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus for the first time. Received treatment: methotrexate 10 mg/week, prednisolone 20 mg/day, movalis, chimes, pentoxifylline, physiotherapy with a positive effect. However, against the background of the constant intake of these drugs, at the end of October 2006, pain in the joints increased again, hyperemia of the back of the nose and cheeks, itching of the skin of the face, swelling on the face and hands, periodic pain behind the sternum and in the left half of the chest, palpitations, shortness of breath with slight physical exertion, general weakness, sore throat, pain in the lumbar region during physical exertion.
       In 2008, 2009, she underwent inpatient treatment using efferent therapy methods for repeated exacerbations of systemic lupus erythematosus with a moderate effect. 
       Over the past three years, he has been noted an increase in blood pressure up to 170/110 mmHg, accompanied by dizziness, nausea, and palpitations. From the same time - unsteadiness when walking, numbness in the fingers of the upper limbs. 
       In May 2010, she underwent inpatient treatment for progressive angina pectoris. Over the next year, there were attacks of stable angina, characteristic of level 2 FC. Occasionally noted attacks of palpitations, mainly at night, lasting up to 20 minutes, stopped on their own.
       Episodic pain in the epigastric region notes for ten years, was treated independently, taking a large number of antisecretory and antacid drugs, with a temporary positive effect. On December 22, 2010, laparoscopic surgery was performed to eliminate the incarceration of the paraesophageal hernia (laparoscopic posterior crurorrhaphy, Nissen-Rosetti fundoplication. K 44.9). 
        At the time of hospitalization, he regularly takes: Prednisone 5 mg - 2 tab. in the morning with breakfast until 9 am - all the time; Methotrexate 2.5 mg - 1 tab. 3 times a week (Saturday morning and evening 1 tab., Sunday morning 1 tab.) - constantly; Sorbifer durules - 1 capsule in the morning; Movalis - 1 suppository in the morning with exacerbation of the articular syndrome; Concor-core - 1 tab. in the morning.
        Real deterioration: on May 9, 2011, at about 9 am, I woke up from pressing pain in the left side of my chest, pronounced palpitations, and significant general weakness. Independently took the entire list of medications taken without effect. Given the ineffectiveness of self-therapy, she called an ambulance team, which was taken to the hospital therapy clinic for diagnosis and treatment with a diagnosis of "first-time detected paroxysm of atrial fibrillation."
       
       Objective status at admission: Height 164 cm, body weight at admission 64 kg. The general condition is severe, due to signs of electrical instability of the myocardium, arrhythmogenic shock. The position is passive. Satisfactory nutrition: BMI 24.4 kg/m2. The skin in the "décolleté" area is hyperpigmented, ecchymosis on the skin of the face, chest, abdomen, and extremities. Peripheral (submandibular, maxillary, cervical and axillary) lymph nodes are moderately enlarged, painless on palpation, not soldered to surrounding tissues. Movement in the joints is not limited, in the ankle, knee and small joints of the hands are moderately painful, edematous. On palpation of the radial arteries, the pulse is non-synchronous, the same on both hands, rhythmic, with a frequency of 158 beats. per minute, weak filling, uniform, weak tension, the vascular wall is palpated outside the pulse wave. The monitor registers supraventricular tachycardia with a heart rate of 158/min. SatO2=92%. Blood pressure: on the right shoulder - 80/60, on the left shoulder - 80/60 mm Hg. Art. Limits of relative cardiac dullness: right and upper are normal; left - on the left mid-clavicular line. The heart sounds are deaf, over the apex of the heart the 1st tone is weakened, systolic murmur at the apex. The respiratory rate is 24 per minute.

      Anamnesis of the disease He considers himself ill since February 18, 2011, when, against the background of complete well-being, he noted weakness, malaise, body aches, fever to febrile values ​​​​(39.0 ° C), dry cough. He did not apply for medical help, he independently took NSAIDs, antiviral agents (ingaverin). Over the next 6 days, it increased slightlyst, fatigue, chills, increased sweating, body aches, cough with a small amount of sputum appeared from time to time. 24.02. and on February 25, 2011, he felt better, noted a decrease in body temperature to subfebrile numbers, and went to work. From the middle of the day on February 25, 2011, weakness, chills resumed, an increase in body temperature up to 39.00C was again noted, and the general state of health worsened. In the future, the complaints described above intensified, a sharp weakness appeared, making it difficult to move around the room. On March 2, 2011, an ambulance was taken to the HT clinic for urgent indications, at the prehospital stage, due to the identified severe hypotension, 400 ml of Quadrosol solution, 16 mg of Dexamethasone solution were intravenously administered.  
      Over the past 30 years, he has been suffering from bronchial asthma (atopic form), constantly taking Seretide 25 mcg / 125 mcg PDA. Asthmatic status in 2006. In the 1990s, psoriasis was diagnosed.

The skin of the lips is pale pink. Acrocyanosis. On the skin of the legs, thighs hyperemic papules with peeling up to 4 cm in diameter (psoriasis). On the radial arteries, a threadlike pulse is palpable, the same on both hands, rhythmic, with a frequency of 118 per minute, weak filling and tension. Arterial pressure: 60/- mm. rt. Art. On auscultation, the heart sounds are muffled, rhythmic, the first tone at the apex is sharply weakened. The chest is of the correct form, symmetrical. The respiratory rate when breathing atmospheric air is 32 per minute, shallow breathing. With comparative percussion, dullness of percussion sound is determined in the projection of the lower loli of the lungs. Auscultation over the lungs on both sides is determined by hard breathing; over all fields of the lungs on both sides, foci of multiple moist sonorous small bubbling rales are heard. SatO2 without inhalation of humidified oxygen 78-82%, with inhalation - 88%. The edge of the liver protrudes from under the costal arch by 3 cm, soft-elastic consistency, sharp, somewhat painful on palpation. The spleen is not palpable. Ragosa's symptom is positive.
      As a result of the treatment: 
• IVL with PEEP within 3 hours from the moment of admission, 
• inotropic support for 2.5 days (maximum dose of dopamine 10 µg/kg×day), removed from inotropic support at 23:30 on 04.03.11 .HELL when transferring = / mmHg 
• continuous mask oxygen therapy, 
• complex metabolic and detoxification therapy (neoton 4g/day, cytoflavin 10 ml/day, mildronate 10 ml/day, calcium gluconate (correction of significant hypocalcemia), ascorbic acid), 
• avelox 400 mg 1 r/day, 
• Invanz 1.0×1 time per day, 
• Tamiflu 0.075, 1 tab 2 r/day,

• Ascoril - 1 tbsp. spoon 3 times a day, 
• Prednisolone 60 mg×4 times a day intravenously (from 04.03.11, the dose was reduced to 30 mg×4 times a day intravenously), there was an improvement in the general condition. 
      The right subclavian vein was catheterized on March 2, 2011. 
      At present, he is oxygen-dependent (when breathing atmospheric air, Sat O2 = 88%!) 
      
      Results of instrumental studies: 
      X-ray of the chest organs on March 2, 2011: bilateral polysegmental infiltration of the pulmonary pattern with increased pattern of the pleura . 
      ECG 02; 03.02; 03/04/2011: sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 118 per minute, horizontal EOS, left ventricular hypertrophy. Subsequently, a decrease in heart rate is noted.

Certificate of incapacity for work: No.                 
Clinical outcome (underline): recovery, improvement, no change, chronicity, disability 
Outcome: discharged due to improvement 

      Admission complaints: moderate weakness, sweating, thirst, dry mouth, shortness of breath and discomfort in the left half of the chest with moderate physical exertion, periodically headaches mainly in the occipital region, weight gain.
     History of the disease: in 2006, during inpatient examination and treatment, type 2 diabetes mellitus was first detected. The level of sugar in the blood measures independently when absolutely necessary with the Aku Chek glucometer. The patient has been suffering from ischemic heart disease and hypertension for a long time since 2000. He was repeatedly hospitalized in various clinics of the Military Medical Academy. The last hospitalization in the HT clinic was from 18.01 to 03.02.2010. He did not take antihypertensive and hypoglycemic drugs. Over the past year, he has noted an increase in blood pressure rises, an increase in the severity of headaches. 
     Present worsening: during the last week he noted an increase in blood glucose levels up to 20 mmol / l (measured independently). In this connection, he turned to the GT clinic and was hospitalized.
     Objective status at admission: general condition of moderate severity, due to decompensation of diabetes mellitus, the manifestation of which is diabetic ketosis. Hypersthenic constitution. Increased nutrition. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Heart rate 88 per minute, no deficit, rhythmic pulse, satisfactory properties. On auscultation, the heart sounds are muffled, the emphasis of the second tone is on the aorta, BP is 120/80 mm Hg, there is vesicular breathing in the lungs, no wheezing. the abdomen is soft, painless on palpation, the liver is along the edge of the costal arch, effleurage along the lumbar region is painless on both sides.
     The following treatment was carried out: parenterally: glucose (5%-200 ml/day), MgSO4 (25%-5 ml/day), KCl (5%-30 ml/day), Humulin (12 U/day) . Inside: aspirin 100 mg/day, galvusmet 150/1500 mg/day, enalapril 5 mg/day, verapamil 120 mg/day. 
     As a result of the treatment, the state of health improved, blood glucose was within acceptable limits, cardiac pain syndrome did not recur, exercise tolerance was satisfactory, blood pressure was within normal values.  
     
     
     
The results of instrumental studies: 
ECG on December 23, 2011: heart rate - 100 per minute. Moderate sinus tachycardia. The horizontal position of the electrical axis of the heart to the left. Hypertrophy of the left heart. Violation of repolarization processes in the region of the posterior wall.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY 20.12.2011 № 47 Aorta: d=29 mm; Aortic valve: opening 21 mm; Left atrium: 40 mm; Mitral valve: S>4 cm2; left ventricle: KSR 33 mm, KDR 50 mm, FU 33%; Ejection fraction (Teicholz)=61%; Posterior wall: diast 11.2 mm, interventricular septum: diast 11.2 mm. Pulmonary artery: 19 mm; Right atrium: 37 mm; Right ventricle: KDR 27 mm, anterior wall: diast <5 mm. Conclusion: Initial manifestations of aortic atherosclerosis. Diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. Left ventricular hypertrophy.
24-hour ECG monitoring on December 13, 2011: during the observation period, sinus rhythm was recorded with a heart rate of 64 to 138 per minute. During wakefulness, tachycardia was recorded with an average hourly heart rate of 94 to 122 per minute. The decrease in heart rate at night is adequate. Average heart rate 96 (N to 85)/103/77 per minute. Registered single supraventricular extrasystoles (total 95), periodically paired. When performing the planned load (staircase test, 55 and 56 steps), the heart rate reached 116 and 125 per minute, the patient noted shortness of breath, palpitations. Ischemic changes in the ST segment were not detected.

     Outcome: discharged due to improvement 
     
     Complaints at admission: moderate severe general weakness, sweating, thirst, dry mouth, shortness of breath and discomfort in the left half of the chest cell with moderate physical exertion, periodically headaches mainly in the occipital region against the background of an increase in blood pressure to 180/115 mm Hg, weight gain.
     Anamnesis of the disease: considers himself ill since 1999, when he first noted the appearance of a headache against the background of an increase in blood pressure to 160/110 mm Hg. Not treated. In 2003, during a hospital examination, hypertension of the second stage was diagnosed. The maximum figures for blood pressure are 220/120 mm Hg. He took enalapril, amlodipine with a temporary positive effect. Since 2008, the disease has acquired a crisis character with an episode of transient ischemic attack in the LSMA pool (November 30, 2010). Significant lability of blood pressure levels (130-220/80-120 mm Hg) over the past 5 years required frequent correction of antihypertensive therapy in stationary conditions with an increase in the doses of drugs taken (currently taking co-exforge 10/160/12, 5 mg, arterial hypertension at the level of mild arterial hypertension). Since 2007 began to notice episodes of palpitations, interruptions in the work of the heart. In 2009, a rhythm disorder was diagnosed according to the type of frequent ventricular extrasystole, against the background of taking antiarrhythmic drugs, extrasystole is less pronounced. Pain in the region of the heart during physical, psycho-emotional stress has been noted since 2007. Coronary heart disease has been diagnosed on a stationary basis, periodically taking kardiket, nitrospray. Since 2003, he has been experiencing an increase in blood glucose levels; he was hospitalized with type 2 diabetes mellitus; he took sorbifer without effect. Since 2010, he has been taking Siofor 850 mg 2 times a day, Protofan 36 units in the morning and 38 units in the evening, which allowed him to maintain a normal level of glycemia throughout the year. Over the past year, he began to notice an increase in blood glucose levels up to 15-16 mmol/l, he did not seek medical help. Independently increased the dose of Siofor taken to 1000 mg 2 times a day with little effect. An increase in microalbumin in the urine since 2007, at the same time, diabetic nephropathy was diagnosed. Increase in body weight for more than 20 years, during the last 3 years the weight is stable. Pain in the spine during physical exertion since 1997. He was treated on an outpatient and inpatient basis with a short-term positive effect. Pain in the epigastric region with an error in the diet since 1994, chronically diagnosed gastroduodenitis on an outpatient basis, occasionally taking Almagel, omeprazole with a positive effect. In May 2009, he was dismissed from the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for health reasons. Real deterioration: during the last three months, when, against the background of errors in the diet, he began to notice an increase in blood glucose levels up to 20 mmol / l (measured independently),
     Objective status at admission: general condition of moderate severity, due to decompensation of diabetes mellitus, the manifestation of which is diabetic ketosis. Hypersthenic constitution. Increased nutrition (BMI 40kg/m2). Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Heart rate 88 per minute, no deficit, rhythmic pulse, satisfactory properties. On auscultation, the heart sounds are muffled, the emphasis of the second tone is on the aorta, BP is 160/95 mm Hg, there is vesicular breathing in the lungs, no wheezing. The abdomen is soft, painless on palpation, the liver is along the edge of the costal arch, effleurage along the lumbar region is painless on both sides. Edema of the lower third of the legs and feet.
     Treatment was carried out: parenterally: after stopping ketosis in the ICU according to the standard scheme with the transition to the scheme Protofan HB 40 IU in the morning and 50 IU in the evening, Actrapid 40 IU before meals. Inside: aspirin 100 mg/day, galvusmet 150/1500 mg/day, Co-exforge 10/160/12.5.

       Over the past year, I began to notice the frequent appearance of discomfort in the lower part of the chest on both sides, more on the left. From the beginning of October, after physical exertion (ascent to the 5th floor), attacks of nausea, vomiting of bile with episodes of blood streaks in it appeared, and general weakness began to increase. On October 18, 2013, after physical exertion (6-hour service), a sharp weakness developed, blackout in the eyes, followed by a short-term loss of consciousness. As he fell, he hit the corner of the table with his spatula. After this episode, there was a significant weakness, a cough with a bloody discharge (did not occur during the last three days). The presence of seizures denies. According to urgent indications, he was hospitalized in the city clinical hospital No. 40 (Sestroretsk), where, according to the patient, pulmonary embolism was ruled out and this condition was explained by the presence of an anomaly of the cervical vertebrae (copies of the examination results, including the result of a CT scan of the head and chest, are pasted into the present medical history, the discharge summary is not presented). Considering that his state of health does not allow him to properly perform his duties, he turned to the hospital therapy clinic, where, after examination, he was hospitalized to the clinic for further diagnosis and treatment.
       
      As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet No. 10, antiplatelet, antihypertensive, diuretic, metabolic, cardioprotective, mucolytic, antibacterial therapy, the state of health improved. The maximum possible compensation of the functions of internal organs and systems has been achieved.

      On admission: 
       Complaints of weakness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, local pain in the left side of the chest.
       The real worsening of the state of health came on the afternoon of 10/19/2014, when, while taking nitrospray for pain in the left side of the chest, the patient lost consciousness (the duration of the syncope is unknown). The patient refused the hospitalization offered by the emergency medical service team. Regularly takes phenobarbital for epilepsy (dose in the last day is unknown). On the morning of January 20, 2014 there was nausea, vomiting. Social transport delivered to the hospital therapy clinic VMedA. In the course of the survey, no convincing data were obtained for acute coronary syndrome (chest pain the day before and taking nitrospray for this reason) (chest pain was regarded as thoracalgia of non-cardiac origin). Loss of consciousness the day before, most likely due to orthostatic hypotension while taking nitrospray. Attention is drawn to the pronounced cerebral symptoms. The main severity of the condition at the time of hospitalization on 20.01.2014. caused cerebral symptoms, within which a differential diagnostic search was carried out between acute cerebrovascular accident in the vertebrobasilar basin and poisoning (overdose) of antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital). Taking into account the obtained MRI data (according to sito), the results of a toxicological blood test for barbiturates, the patient had toxic encephalopathy due to an overdose of barbiturates. In order to conduct detoxification therapy, the patient was urgently transferred, in agreement with the leadership of the department of military field therapy, to a specialized toxicological department of resuscitation and intensive care of the VPT clinic, where complex detoxification therapy was carried out. According to the stabilization of the state on 21.01.2014. at 18:30 she was again admitted to the hospital therapy clinic by transfer from the ICU. In the course of the examination, it was found that diseases of the internal organs are of a compensated nature and do not require additional correction of the therapy. Dominant in the picture of the disease is the pathology of the central nervous system, which does not require urgent medical intervention and the patient can undergo further treatment on an outpatient basis. that diseases of the internal organs are compensated and do not require additional correction of the therapy.

      History of present illness. Episodic headaches against the background of an increase in blood pressure have been a concern since 2000. In 2002, he was diagnosed with hypertension. Repeatedly passed inpatient treatment in the clinics of the Academy (VPT, Nervous diseases). Due to the ineffectiveness of the therapy, the appearance of edema and pain in the left foot, in 2007 he was examined inpatiently at the Clinic of Faculty Therapy of the Military Medical Academy, where he was diagnosed with an advanced metabolic syndrome ("Primary gout mixed variant. Acute gouty arthritis with damage to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot. Secondary osteoarthritis of the shoulder and knee joints FNS I. Hypertension stage II (AH 2, CVC risk 4) Atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary arteries, atherosclerotic cardiosclerosis without signs of heart failure.

Fatty hepatosis 1 degree. Chronic discogenic radiculopathy with L4-L5 radicular syndrome on the left, with pain and muscular-tonic syndrome in remission). Since the same time, pronounced diffuse repolarization disorders have been detected on the ECG. In the future, against the background of constant neuropsychic overstrain, he noted an increase in the level of blood pressure, mainly diastolic, the appearance of edema of the legs and feet. In order to stabilize the condition, various combinations of drugs were used on an outpatient basis: Tarka, Prestarium, Arifon-retard, Amlodipine, Cordaflex... However, all combinations were effective only for a short time after their appointment, further there was a re-increase in the level of diastolic blood pressure. He regularly took allopurinol 1-2 times a year for prophylactic purposes. Over the past year, against the background of constant neuropsychic overwork, he began to fall asleep with difficulty, independently used Morozov's drops, gradually increasing their dose to 5-10 ml before bedtime. With an increase in the level of diastolic blood pressure over 130 mm Hg. (during the first days of January 2012) began to notice pronounced pressing pains behind the sternum, independently took nitroglycerin with a positive effect.

      Complaints of episodic pain in the epigastric region of a aching nature, decreasing after eating, aggravated on an empty stomach (hungry pain) and at night, heartburn, nausea, general weakness. 
      Anamnesis of the present disease (Anamnesis morbi): 
      Periodic aching pain in the epigastric region and heartburn after an error in nutrition has been noted since 2006, he did not seek medical help. FEGDS in 2007 verified chronic gastritis in the acute stage, was treated on an outpatient basis, took antacids with temporary improvement. In the future, abdominal pain syndrome recurred after errors in nutrition with a frequency of 2-3 times a year. He treated himself, took almagel with a good effect. Over the past year, abdominal pain has intensified and become more frequent.
      On October 11, 2011, FEGDS revealed multiple (two) ulcers of the duodenal bulb. He was treated permanently in the clinic of faculty therapy for newly diagnosed peptic ulcer. On the background of the therapy, scarring of ulcerative defects was achieved. In the future, he took antacid drugs for relapses of abdominal pain syndrome with temporary improvement. Deterioration of well-being a month after discharge, when, after a nutritional error, aching pains in the epigastric region, heartburn, "night" pains recurred, he took Almagel, Omez with little effect. On November 16, 2011, FEGDS revealed an ulcer of the duodenal bulb. In this connection, he underwent inpatient treatment at the FT clinic from 22.11 to 12.12.2011.
      Within a month after discharge, he felt satisfactorily, however, with a slight error in the diet, he noted the appearance of heartburn, sour eructation, which forced him to increase the dose of antacids taken on his own, and had a negative effect on the performance of official duties.

DISCLAIMER CASE 
HISTORY №, ARCHIVE №_________ 
Surname, name, patronymic: born in 1949 
She was hospitalized at the hospital therapy clinic
In total, 10 days of treatment were carried out 
. ICD Code M 17.9 MES 381020 
									          
Diagnosis: 
      Secondary nephropathy of mixed (atherosclerotic, hypertensive, nephritic) genesis. Chronic bilateral pyelonephritis, exacerbation phase. Cysts of the right kidney. Chronic kidney disease stage 4 (GFR 24 ml/h). Proteinuria. Chronic renal failure stage 1a. Neoplasm of both adrenal glands. 
      Arterial hypertension of mixed (essential, renoparenchymal) genesis of III degree → drug normotension, the risk of CVE is "very high". 
      Coronary artery disease. Atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary arteries. Atherosclerotic cardiosclerosis complicated by paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (without exacerbation).
      Heart failure II functional class 2a stage. 
       Bronchial asthma of mixed genesis (infection-dependent, primary altered bronchial reactivity) of moderate course, remission without respiratory failure. 
       Fixed hiatal hernia. Chronic atrophic gastritis, erosive bulbitis, exacerbation. 
       Alimentary-constitutional obesity of the 2nd degree (BMI-37.6 kg/m2), stable course. 

Certificate of incapacity for work: not issued 
Total radiation dose 1.4 mSv 
Clinical outcome: improvement. 
Outcome: discharged. 
      Upon enrolment:
      Complaints: frequent bouts of palpitations, increased blood pressure up to 190/150 mm Hg, episodic attacks of suffocation accompanied by wheezing, coughing with white bloody discharge, pain in the right hypochondrium and epigastric region with errors in diet.
      History of present illness. She suffered from chronic bronchitis for a long time. in 2011, the disease acquired a protracted course with frequent attacks of dyspnea, which prevented active seeking medical help. Bronchial asthma was verified on a stationary basis, adequate therapy was selected for outpatient admission (Seretide-multidisc 50/250 1 dose 1 time per day and berodual 2 doses 2 times a day). In the same year, she was operated on for urolithiasis on both sides, the stones were removed. In the postoperative period, she began to notice a significant increase in blood pressure, mainly due to diastolic blood pressure, palpitations, weakness, and her weight began to progressively increase (over the past 2 years, body weight has been stable). Takes diltiazem without visible effect.
      
     As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet No. 7, Seretide-multidisc, Berodual, Acecardol, Amlodipine, Omeprazole, Furosemide, Ciprofloxacin, the state of health improved.
      The patient was consulted by Professor Barsukov A.V. It has been determined that at present the course of concomitant diseases is of the maximum possible compensated character. The severity of the condition and the prognosis determine the functional state of the excretory function of the kidneys and the existing neoplasms of the adrenal glands, which make a significant contribution to the maintenance of arterial hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Despite the convincing effect of the prescribed therapy, it is recommended that the patient undergo an additional examination on an outpatient basis in order to determine the functional state of the adrenal glands, perform a blood test for catecholamines, plasma renin activity, aldosterone levels (after discontinuation of drugs that affect the RAAS system for 14 days) followed by a consultation nephrologist.
      
      Results of instrumental studies:

Taking into account the resistance of pathological exudation in the right pleural cavity to diuretic therapy and mechanical removal of fluid during pleural punctures, as well as taking into account the one-sidedness of the effusion (right pleural cavity), in further diagnosis, exclude a neoplasm of the right lung, mediastinum, and abdominal organs. 

The results of instrumental studies: 

ECG 23.12.2010, heart rate - 100 beats sinus rhythm, EOS to the right. Hypertrophy of the right ventricle. Widespread cicatricial changes in the anterior-septal, apical-lateral section of the left ventricle. Diffuse disorders of repolarization. Complete blockade of the right leg of the bundle of His.
ECG from 01/13/2011: sinus rhythm, heart rate 85 per minute. Violations of the processes of repolarization along the lower wall, rhythm disturbance in the form of frequent ventricular extrasystoles persist. 
Ultrasound of the abdominal organs on December 27, 2011: no ascites. Flatulence. Diffuse changes in the echostructure of the liver (according to the type of hepatosis). Ultrasound signs of circulatory failure. 
Ultrasound of the abdominal organs on 01/06/2011: compared to 12/27/2010 without dynamics. Hydrothorax on the right.

       Complaints: pressing pains behind the sternum that occur during physical exertion, sensations of interruptions in the work of the heart, episodes of palpitations, shortness of breath when climbing to the second floor, walking up to 200 meters, diffuse headache, dizziness with an increase in blood pressure up to 160/110 mm. rt. Art., working 130/80 mm. rt. Art., general weakness, fatigue, irritability, memory loss, sleep disturbance, periodic dry mouth and thirst, heartburn with errors in the diet.
       History of present illness. Since childhood, he often suffered from tonsillitis. In 1985, he was diagnosed with chronic tonsillitis, for which he was treated on an outpatient and inpatient basis. In 1995, after a sore throat, an infectious-allergic myocarditis developed, which proceeded with severe disturbances in heart rhythm and conduction. Subsequently, myocardial cardiosclerosis was formed with conduction disturbance in the form of a complete blockade of the right bundle branch of His, blockade of the anterior branch of the left bundle of His bundle. In the future, he was repeatedly treated for this in a hospital. Since 1999, she has been worried about shortness of breath during physical exertion; during a hospital examination, heart failure of the first functional class was verified. Since 2000, he has been worried about interruptions in the work of the heart, and frequent ventricular extrasystoles have been detected. Since 2004, pressing pains behind the sternum during physical exertion began to disturb, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris of the first functional class was diagnosed in a hospital, a constant intake of nitrates, antiplatelet agents was recommended, the patient partially fulfilled these recommendations. In August 2008, there was a hemodynamically significant paroxysm of ventricular tachycardia, stopped by electropulse therapy. In December 2008, coronary angiography was performed, in which angiographic signs of atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries were not detected. In April 2009, when performing an endocardial electrophysiological study of the heart, stable paroxysms of ventricular tachycardia were induced from the outflow tract of the right ventricle. In this regard, on April 15, 2009, a cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted. In the future, the patient continues to be disturbed by pressing pains in the chest and shortness of breath during physical exertion, interruptions in the work of the heart. As a result, he was repeatedly hospitalized. Headache against the background of episodes of increased blood pressure up to 150/100 mm Hg. Art. worried since 1986. Since 1995, he has been observed for neurocirculatory asthenia of the hypertensive type, occasionally taking antihypertensive drugs with a positive effect. Since 2004, an increase in blood pressure to 150/100 mm Hg. Art. takes a persistent character, at a hospital examination, hypertension of the first stage is diagnosed. In 2008, against the background of constant intake of antihypertensive drugs, there were rises in blood pressure up to 160/100 mm Hg. Art., stationary diagnosed with hypertension of the second stage, the initial manifestation of cerebrovascular insufficiency. In September 2011, he suffered a hypertensive crisis, stopped permanently. Since 2000, he has noted the appearance of episodic dry mouth, thirst, was observed due to impaired glucose tolerance. In 2003, during a hospital examination, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a mild course, was established. Until 2008, compensation was achieved by diet. Since 2008, hypoglycemic drugs have been added to the diet. In 2003, during a hospital examination, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a mild course, was established. Until 2008, compensation was achieved by diet. Since 2008, hypoglycemic drugs have been added to the diet. In 2003, during a hospital examination, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a mild course, was established. Until 2008, compensation was achieved by diet. Since 2008, hypoglycemic drugs have been added to the diet.
Currently taking Glibomet. Against this background, diabetes is compensated. In April 2009, a diffusely nodular goiter was detected without functional impairment. About fifteen years worried about heartburn with errors in the diet. Since 2003, chronic gastritis has been detected. In July 2009, the VVK was surveyed (a copy of the document is attached). In the course of this deterioration in health, he was hospitalized at the GT clinic of the Military Medical Academy for further examination and treatment.
      As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet N9 Sol. NaCl-200ml Sol. Espalipon 24.0 IV drip N5, T. Carvedilol 37.5 mg/day, T. Preductal 70 mg/day, T. Aspicor 100 mg/day, T. Atoris 20 mg/day, T. Ramipril 2.5 mg/day, T. Glibomet 1600 mg/day, T. Detralex, T. Vazobral, there is a positive trend: the pain syndrome did not recur, blood pressure is stabilized and corresponds to the target values ​​(normotension is maintained). He notes an increase in working capacity, an increase in tolerance to physical activity. Therapy for the outpatient stage of treatment was selected, recommendations were given.

    Anamnesis of the disease: Collection of anamnesis is difficult due to severe cognitive impairment. For a long time (more than 10 years) hypertension, coronary disease, noted cardiac arrhythmias. On this occasion, he is observed by a cardiologist at a polyclinic at the place of residence; he has repeatedly been treated and examined in cardiological hospitals. In 2000, he suffered a stroke, which was complicated by left-sided deep hemiparesis, hemihypesthesia (they still persist). The last hospitalization in a therapeutic hospital in August 2013 (clinic of faculty therapy of the Military Medical Academy), was diagnosed with: “CHD. Angina pectoris III FC. Atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary arteries. Atherosclerotic cardiosclerosis with arrhythmia according to the type of paroxysmal form of atrial fibrillation, conduction according to the type of AV blockade of the first degree. Hypertension stage III. CHF II-a stage, 2 FC. TsVB. Stage III DEP of mixed (post-stroke (2000), atherosclerotic) genesis in the form of left-sided deep hemiparesis, hemihypersthesia, cognitive impairment ”(copy of the discharge certificate in the medical history). The patient was discharged with improvement, the following therapy was recommended: losartan 12.5 mg/day, veroshpiron 50 mg/day, diuver 5 mg/day, pradaxa 220 mg/day, sotalol 40 mg/day. The regularity of taking drugs is observed (according to the patient). Deterioration of health has been noted since December 2013, shortness of breath has increased, edema of the lower extremities has appeared, lability of blood pressure levels, pains in the heart area, interruptions in the work of the heart, began to notice a decrease in exercise tolerance.
    According to the patient, in 2000 he was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis, subclinical hypothyroidism. On this occasion, it is observed by an endocrinologist. August 2013 - subclinical hypothyroidism; dose of L-thyroxine 25 mcg/day. In November 2013, thyroid status was monitored: T3, T4, TSH, and/tPO were normal values ​​(results on the hands), L-thyroxine was canceled by the endocrinologist.
    Objectively at the time of admission: the general condition is satisfactory. Consciousness is clear. The skin and visible mucous membranes are clean, dry, turgor is reduced. Limitation of motor activity of the left upper and lower extremities (left-sided hemiparesis due to previous ischemic stroke). The physique is correct, corresponds to age and sex. Normal nutrition: the thickness of the skin fold at the costal arch is 2 cm, near the navel 4 cm. The elasticity of the skin is reduced, slight acrocyanosis of the lips. Diagonal fold of the earlobe, senile arch of the eyes. There are no edema. The pulse is rhythmic, uniform, with a frequency of 80 beats. in min., BP 150 and 100 mm Hg. Heart sounds are muffled, rhythmic, accent II tone over the aorta, there is no pulse deficit. RR 17 per min. On auscultation over the lungs, breathing is vesicular, rales are not heard. The abdomen is soft, painless on palpation. A strengthened scar without signs of inflammation in the right iliac region is determined. The edge of the liver does not protrude from under the edge of the costal arch. The size of the liver according to Kurlov is 10*9*8 cm. The spleen is not palpable. Ragosa's symptom is negative. Tapping on the lumbar region is painless on both sides. There are no dysuric phenomena.
      Treatment was carried out: mode 3, diet 10. Parenterally: NaCl, KCl, glucose, cavinton, cordarone. Inside: blocktran, spironolactone, trigrium, pradaxa, sotohexal, sonizim, finasteride, phenazepam, phenibut, propafenone. In the form of ointments mycoseptin, troxevasin. 
      Against the background of ongoing therapy, hemodynamic parameters are stabilized within the optimal values. The patient notes a moderate improvement in general well-being, increased exercise tolerance.
      
      Repeatedly was on examination and treatment in therapeutic clinics of the Military Medical Academy and city medical institutions, diagnostically clear. Extreme hospitalization in August 2013 to the clinic of faculty therapy (a copy of the discharge summary on hand). Leading in the clinical picture is vascular pathology, represented by the consequences of ischemic stroke in the form of stage III dyscirculatory encephalopathy, left-sided hemiparesis, hemihypesthesia, and cognitive impairment; angina pectoris II-III functional classes, arterial hypertension with moderate symptoms of chronic heart failure, rare paroxysms of atrial fibrillation.

      The goals of therapy were achieved: manifestations of chronic heart failure, congestive pneumonia were stopped, the maximum possible compensation of the function of internal organs was achieved at this stage. organs and systems, the genesis of pronounced congestion was determined, and therapy was selected for the initial stage of outpatient treatment. In a satisfactory condition, he is discharged to the polyclinic at the place of residence under the supervision of specialist doctors. 
      
Recommended: 
 57. Lifelong dispensary supervision of a nephrologist, endocrinologist, cardiologist at the place of residence.
 58. Control study (at least once every 3 months): ECG, general blood and urine tests, blood tests for cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, creatinine, potassium, urea, glucose. 
 59. Determination of blood levels of T3, T4, antibodies to thyroglobulin, cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone - 2 times a year, followed by correction based on the results of a dose of levothyroxine 
 60. Continuous monitoring of body weight !!! with an increase in body weight of more than 1 kg (in comparison with the discharge data), consultation with a cardiologist in order to exclude the worsening of the course of chronic heart failure and correct (if necessary) the therapy.
 61. Diet: restriction of protein intake with food to 0.8-1 g / kg (up to 50-60 g per day), depending on the severity of renal failure. At the same time, 30 g should be a high-value protein, and only 10 g of protein per day should fall on the share of bread, cereals, potatoes and other vegetables. 30-40 g of complete protein. In general, the patient's menu is compiled within table No. 7. The following products are included in the patient's daily diet: meat (100-120 g), cottage cheese dishes, cereal dishes, semolina, rice, buckwheat, barley porridge. A potato and potato-egg diet is recommended. Particularly suitable due to their low protein content and at the same time high energy value are potato dishes (pancakes, meatballs, grandmothers, fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, etc.), salads with sour cream, vinaigrettes with a significant amount (50-100 g) of vegetable oil. Tea or coffee can be acidified with lemon, put 2-3 tablespoons of sugar in a glass, it is recommended to use honey, jam, jam. Thus, the main composition of food is carbohydrates and fats and dosed - proteins. Calculating the daily amount of protein in the diet is a must.

      Approximate diet: 
• Breakfast: Soft-boiled egg + Rice porridge 60 g + Honey 50 g 
• Lunch: Fresh cabbage soup 300 g + Fried fish with mashed potatoes 150 g + Apples 
• Dinner: Mashed potatoes 300 g + Vegetable salad 200 g + Milk 200 d 
      Correction of water balance disorders: take enough liquid to maintain diuresis in the range of 1.5-2.0 liters per day. 
      Correction of electrolyte imbalance: salt intake should be limited to 5 g per day 
 62. Continue taking: 
• Amlodipine 5 mg - 1 tab. in the morning constantly;

      History of present illness. At the age of 6 months, due to the developed complex (thin-thin) ileocolic intussusception, the operation of resection of the ileocecal angle with anastomosis of the small intestine to the side of the large intestine (submersible anastomosis) was performed. In the future, she often noted pain in the abdomen. In 1994, she was hospitalized for chronic gastroduodenitis. During the second pregnancy (5 years ago), she significantly gained body weight (since then her body weight has been stable) up to 94 kg, varicose veins of the lower extremities appeared and she began to notice the appearance of discomfort in the right iliac region, stool instability, bloating, excessive gas formation. In 2007, she independently identified the node of the inner quadrant of the left breast, was consulted by a mammologist at the regional hospital (fibrocystic mastopathy). In June 2013, she was consulted on an outpatient basis by a gastroenterologist (on FGDS there were signs of gastroduodenitis), a course of therapy was recommended, which included platifilin s / c, pariet, duspatalin, drip administration of drugs (analgin, papaverine) with a positive effect. In August 2013, while on vacation (Greece), she began to notice significant swelling of the feet and legs, heartburn, and “bitterness” in her mouth. Taking into account that the state of health does not allow to properly perform official duties, she was routinely hospitalized to the hospital therapy clinic for diagnosis and treatment. while on vacation (Greece), she began to notice significant swelling of the feet and legs, heartburn, and “bitterness” in her mouth.

      Results of instrumental studies:
       UZDG from 06/04/2010: the blood flow has the features of the main one, without signs of AVM and local stenosis, without pathological overflows. LBF in all located arteries is within acceptable limits, without significant asymmetry. The range of cerebrovascular reactivity was preserved in full. 
       MRI of the brain dated 04.06.2010: Conclusion: MRI signs of the initial manifestations of dyscirculatory encephalopathy, uneven expansion of the subarachnoid space. 
       ECG from. 06/03/2010: sinus rhythm with heart rate = 88 in 1 min., horizontal EOS. Incomplete blockade of the right leg of the bundle of His. The predominance of the potentials of the left ventricle.
       ECHO-KG dated 06/03/2010: MZHP-12mm, ZS-11mm, KDRLZh-51mm, KSRLZh-34mm, FV-62%, FU-34%, UO-77ml, LP-40×40×50mm, PP-38 ×47mm, RV-25mm, E/A=1.1 IMMlzh-142g/m2 Myocardium is symmetrically thickened. The kinetics is not broken. The cavities are free, not dilated, the valves are not changed, there is valvular regurgitation on the pulmonic valve. The aorta is sealed. The pericardium is intact. 
       VEM dated 06/01/2010: functional class - 2. The VEM test was carried out against the background of antihypertensive therapy. The test is negative (no signs of coronary circulation disorders were detected). Load tolerance is average. BP response is adequate.
       24-hour ECG monitoring from May 31, 2010: during monitoring, sinus rhythm was recorded with a heart rate of 47 to 170 per minute. The decrease in heart rate at night is adequate. Average heart rate 84/85/62 per minute. Registered single ventricular extrasystoles (2); solitary supraventricular, periodically frequent (from 13:00 to 14:00 - 103 extrasystoles; from 15:00 to 17:00 - 101 extrasystoles; in total 263 per day), with episodes of the type of bi- and trigeminia. At 21:25, a single episode of transient 2nd degree type 2 AV blockade (Mobitz 2) was registered with a pause of 2 seconds. When performing the planned load, the heart rate reached 166 and 170 in 1 minute, subjectively noted the heartbeat. Ischemic changes in the ST segment were not detected.
       24-hour blood pressure monitoring from May 31, 2010: the study was performed against the background of antihypertensive therapy (amlodipine, enalapril). Mean systolic BP in the daytime is typical for mild labile hypertension, at night the average systolic BP is within the normal range. Mean diastolic BP during the day is typical for mild stable hypertension, at night - for moderate stable hypertension. At night, systolic and diastolic blood pressure fall adequately (dipper). The variability of systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the day is within the acceptable range. There is an increase in the magnitude of the morning rise in diastolic blood pressure, the speed of the morning rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Episodes of hypotension were not registered.

The spleen is not enlarged, 10 × 4.5 cm in size.
       X-ray of the chest organs from 27.05.2010. Conclusion: without focal and infiltrative changes. Roots are structural. The heart is dilated to the left. The aorta is sealed.
       FGDS from 05/31/201: the esophagus is passable, the cardial rosette does not close completely. In the stomach, the folds are rough, edematous, tortuous, can be traced in the antrum, and are easily straightened during insufflation. The mucosa is moderately hyperemic, "motley" in the antrum. The gatekeeper closes completely. The bulb of the duodenum is somewhat deformed due to cicatricial changes. Mucous edematous, with whitish bulges. In the postbulbar region without features, bile is not passaged. Conclusion: insufficiency of the outlet of the cardia. Chronic gastritis (mixed form, follicular bulbitis). Moderate cicatricial deformity of the duodenal bulb. 
       Neurologist: initial manifestations of cerebrovascular insufficiency with scattered neurological symptoms.
       Ophthalmologist: hypertensive angiopathy of both eyes. 
       Cardiac surgeon-arrhythmologist: transient AV blockade of the 2nd degree, type 2

Complaints: increasing dyspnea of ​​a mixed, predominantly inspiratory nature, noted at rest, aggravated in a horizontal position; discomfort in the right half of the chest at rest, paroxysmal cough without discharge, increasing weakness, decreased exercise tolerance.
Disease history. For a long time he suffers from coronary heart disease, hypertension. I have been drinking alcohol for a long time. In 2004, she suffered a massive myocardial infarction. 17.10.10 performed surgical treatment for bleeding (shock 2-3) from a chronic stomach ulcer. During the same hospitalization, decompensated diabetes mellitus was diagnosed. After discharge, she did not comply with the doctor's recommendations, she began to notice an increase in the volume of the abdomen. On this occasion, she was repeatedly hospitalized in the hospitals of the city, where complex treatment was performed with active diuretic therapy. After discharge from the pulmonology department of City Hospital No. 26, his condition deteriorated sharply. From December 23, 2010 to January 14, 2011, she was treated at the GT VMedA clinic. In view of the resistance of pathological exudation in the right pleural cavity to diuretic therapy and mechanical removal of fluid during pleural punctures, in the diagnosis, the patient was recommended to perform a CT scan in order to exclude a neoplasm of the right lung, mediastinum, and abdominal organs. When trying to perform tomography, the study turned out to be uninformative, according to the patient, due to the presence of fluid in the pleural cavity. During the last week, she began to notice an increase in dyspnea, its occurrence at rest. In this connection, she was taken by an ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic for urgent indications. When trying to perform tomography, the study turned out to be uninformative, according to the patient, due to the presence of fluid in the pleural cavity. During the last week, she began to notice an increase in dyspnea, its occurrence at rest. In this connection, she was taken by an ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic for urgent indications.

During the last week, she began to notice an increase in dyspnea, its occurrence at rest. In this connection, she was taken by an ambulance to the hospital therapy clinic for urgent indications.
Objective status: general condition of moderate severity, swelling of the feet, legs, heart rate 90 per minute, no deficit, rhythmic pulse, auscultatory tones of the heart are muffled, the 1st tone is weakened above the apex of the heart, there is a rough systolic murmur at the apex, the boundaries of the heart are expanded, BP 110/60 mm Hg in the lungs, hard breathing, single congestive rales in the lower lobe on the left, on the right, breathing is not heard in the zone of dullness from the level of the 5th rib; the abdomen is not enlarged, soft, painless on palpation, the edge of the liver protrudes 4 cm from under the costal arch, effleurage in the lumbar region is painless on both sides.
As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet No. 9, metabolic therapy (polarizing mixture: Sol.NaCl 0.9% -200.0, Sol.Asparcami 20 ml), inotropic therapy (Korglikon 0.06% 1.0 i.v. drip, Digoxin 0.00025, 0.5 tablets in the morning), hypoglycemic therapy (Maninil 0.0035, 2 tablets per day), antibacterial therapy (Augmentin, 1 tablet 2 times a day), diuretic therapy (Diuver 0.01 1 tab per day, Hypothiazid 0.025, 2 tab. in the morning), beta-adrenolytics (Betaloc-Zok 0.05, 0.25 tab. 2 times a day), antithrombotic therapy (Acecardol 0.1, 1 tab. 1 time per day), hepatoprotective therapy (Essentiale 5.0 No. 5 IV), punctures of the right pleural cavity (January 27, 31, February 07 with evacuation of 2700 ml, 1500 ml, 2000 ml of straw-yellow liquid, subsequent administration of 80 mg of gentamicin intrapleurally), the state of health improved, shortness of breath decreased,cough regressed, edema in the legs disappeared, a small amount of fluid remained in the supraphrenic parts of the right lung.
     Taking into account the resistance of pathological exudation in the right pleural cavity to diuretic therapy and mechanical removal of fluid during pleural punctures, as well as taking into account the one-sidedness of the effusion (right pleural cavity), further diagnosis should still exclude a neoplasm (pleural mesothelioma? 
     ) it is impractical, since this manipulation requires one-lung ventilation of the lungs - the patient will not tolerate this intervention due to functional disorders. 
     Data for tuberculosis were not received. 

Results of instrumental studies:

ECG 02/27/2011, heart rate - 91 per minute Sinus rhythm, EOS to the right. Cicatricial changes in the anterior-septal, apical-lateral section of the left ventricle. Signs of hypertrophy of both ventricles, left atrium. Diffuse disorders of repolarization. Complete blockade of the right leg of the bundle of His.

      This block includes a number of mental disorders grouped together on the basis of the presence of clear etiological factors, namely, the cause of these disorders was brain disease, brain injury or stroke, leading to cerebral dysfunction. Dysfunction can be primary (as in diseases, brain injuries and strokes that directly or selectively affect the brain) and secondary (as in systemic diseases or disorders when the brain is involved in the pathological process along with other organs and systems).
      Dementia [dementia] (F00-F03) is a syndrome caused by damage to the brain (usually chronic or progressive) in which many higher cortical functions are impaired, including memory, thinking, orientation, understanding, counting, learning ability, speech and judgment. Consciousness is not obscured. Cognitive decline is usually accompanied, and sometimes preceded, by deterioration in control of emotions, social behavior, or motivation. This syndrome is noted in Alzheimer's disease, in cerebrovascular diseases, and in other conditions that primarily or secondarily affect the brain. 
      If necessary, an additional code is used to identify the underlying disease.

Certificate of incapacity for work was not issued 
Clinical outcome: improvement 
Outcome: discharged due to improvement 

On admission:
Complaints: dull pressing pain behind the sternum, radiating to the left arm, left shoulder blade, stopped by taking nitroglycerin; shortness of breath with minimal exertion, accompanied by increased heart rate; fast fatigue with minimal physical exertion; feeling of heaviness in the limbs; asthma attacks that occur spontaneously about 1 time per day, stopped by taking salbutamol; swelling of the legs.
Anamnesis of the disease: considers himself ill for about 2 years, when there was a slight shortness of breath during physical exertion, stress. She did not go to the doctors about this, she was not treated, she considered shortness of breath as a manifestation of bronchial asthma, she used salbutamol with a positive effect. In March 2011, she suffered from acute respiratory infections, after which she suffered from acute thrombophlebitis of the right leg, both diseases were accompanied by fever, severe intoxication syndrome, and received antibiotic therapy. In May 2011, shortness of breath increased, weakness in the limbs progressed with minimal physical exertion (walking less than 100 meters, climbing stairs 1 flight). From the age of 17 he suffers from bronchial asthma. Attacks of suffocation occur on contact with animal hair, occupational hazards (substances of dental practice). At 24, at 30, asthmatic status. She did not receive glucocorticoid or combination therapy. She currently takes salbutamol on demand (about once a day). He notes that with age, asthma attacks are less common. In 2008, she suffered an ischemic stroke (according to words), after which residual phenomena remained in the form of impaired writing. The neuropathologist is not observed. Prior to the violation of cerebral circulation, the working pressure was considered 130/80 mm Hg. periodically there were rises in blood pressure up to 160/100 mm Hg. Therapy was prescribed: Renitek, ThromboASS. Over the past two months, she has noted a decrease in blood pressure to 110/70-60 mm Hg, she stopped taking Renitek on her own, but the pressure remains at the level of 110/70 mm Hg. (the words). On June 14, 2011, she felt a worsening condition in the form of pressing pain behind the sternum, which radiated to the left arm, left shoulder blade, treated with nitroglycerin. In connection with the strengthening of the listed complaints, the progression of pain cardiac syndrome for 2 days, according to urgent indications, she was hospitalized in the clinic of GT of the Military Medical Academy.
      Objective status: general condition of moderate severity, swelling of the legs, ankles, on palpation of the radial arteries, the pulse is the same on both arms, rhythmic, 88 beats per minute. Blood pressure: 140/80 mmHg Art. Borders of relative cardiac dullness: right - along the right edge of the sternum; upper - on the third rib; left - on the left mid-clavicular line; on auscultation, the heart sounds are muffled; hard breathing in the lungs, single scattered wheezing in the lower parts of the lungs; the abdomen is soft, painless on palpation; tapping on the lumbar region is painful on both sides.
As a result of the treatment: regimen, diet, metabolic therapy (polarizing mixture: Sol.Glucosae 5% -200 ml, Sol.Asparcami 20 ml, Sol.Insulini 4U), anticoagulant therapy (Heparin 20 thousand U / day), antiplatelet therapy ( Acecardol 0.1 per day), antihypertensive therapy (Perindopril 0.01 per day), preventive antiarrhythmic therapy (Verapamil 0.24 per day), antiplatelet therapy (Acecardol 0.1 per day), mucolytic therapy (Lazolvan 2 ml / day through a nebulizer), glucocorticoids (Dexamethasone according to the scheme with a gradual decrease and withdrawal), vitamin therapy (B12 1000 mcg / day / m, folic acid 6 mg / day) the state of health has improved, cardiac pain syndrome does not bother, exercise tolerance has increased, weakness in the extremities is much less pronounced, occurs on a greater load than before hospitalization,BP is stabilized at the normal level, there is a tendency to normalize the hemogram.
	After relief of cardiac pain syndrome and stabilization of angina pectoris at the level of II f.k. severe anemic syndrome came to the fore. B12 deficiency anemia, iron deficiency anemia, autoimmune nature of the lesion, as well as a mixed variant were considered. The patient was consulted by a hematologist, an examination was carried out in the direction of finding out the cause of anemia. It was established that at the moment there is no need for blood transfusion, blood loss did not occur acutely. An aspiration biopsy of the bone marrow, a blood test for vitamin B12, folic acid were performed. It seems that hemolysis, the signs of which are found in the biochemical analysis of blood, is due to the breakdown of macro- and megalocytes in the spleen and microcirculatory bed, which fits into the framework of B12-folic deficiency anemia. Apparently
	Complete blockade of the left leg of the bundle of His has been taking place since 2008. Against this background, when performing a planned load, an increase in ST segment depression up to 4.0 mm is recorded, which can be regarded as a circulatory disorder. Considering the data of a clinical blood test (the size of erythrocytes is significantly increased), it can be argued that the effects of circulatory disorders are leveled after the restoration of the normal picture of the hemogram. 
       She was consulted by a surgeon about a subcutaneous mass in the angle of the right scapula: preliminary diagnosis: myoma of the right scapular region, targeted radiography of the right scapular region in two projections was recommended. No bone changes were found on sighting radiographs of the right scapula in two projections. 


Results of instrumental studies:

ECG from 06/16/2011: sinus rhythm. The horizontal position of the EOS. Complete blockade of the left leg of the bundle of His. Cicatricial changes in the anterior septal region are not excluded. Hypertrophy of the left heart. 
X-ray of the chest organs from 06/17/2011: the pulmonary fields are moderately emphysematous. The pulmonary pattern in the middle and lower sections on both sides is reinforced and deformed due to pneumofibrosis. The roots of the lungs are structural, not expanded. The sinuses are free. The median shadow is not expanded. 
FVD from 05/24/2011: violation of FVL for obstructive type I degree. The test with Berotek is positive. 
Ultrasound of OMT from 06/22/2011: the uterus is in anteflexio, not enlarged, the ovaries are not located. There is gas in the rectum (preparing for RRS), examination is difficult.
Myelogram dated 06/20/2011: bone marrow cell punctate. The erythroid germ is hyperplastic, megaloblastic. Of 57.4% of erythrokaryocytes, 19.2% are megaloblasts. Leukoerythroblastic ratio 1.3. Attention is drawn to a sharp increase in basophilic erythrokaryocytes, and in peripheral blood preparations, reticulocytosis up to 40%. megalocytes have Jolly bodies, Cabot rings, basophilic puncture. The granulocytic germ is narrowed, there are gigantic forms from myelocytes to p / neutrophils, polysegmentation of neutrophil nuclei. Megalocytic sprout within hematological reference values: platelets lace, 38% megakaryocytes, megakaryoblasts and promegakaryocytes account for 23%. In peripheral blood preparations: hemoglobin 58 g / l, erythrocytes 1.35 * 10 / l, MCH 43.2 pg, MCV 131 dl, anisopoikilocytosis, macrocytes, megalocytes, degenerative forms of erythrocytes, Jolly bodies, Cabot rings. Leukocytes 6.9 * 10 / l with a shift to myelocytes in the leukogram. Platelets 238*10 / l.

Conclusion: thickening of the walls of the aorta, the leaflets of the mitral valve. The chambers of the heart are not dilated, the cavities are free. Concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricular myocardium. Paradoxical movement of the interventricular septum. Global contractility is preserved. Diastolic dysfunction by the type of delayed relaxation. Mitral insufficiency I degree. The pericardium is not changed.
Holter monitoring from 07/01/2011: during the observation period, sinus rhythm was recorded with a heart rate of 60 to 110 per minute. The decrease in heart rate at night is insufficient. Average heart rate 79/83/72 per minute. The following rhythm and conduction disorders were registered: single monomorphic ventricular extrasystoles (3 in total); single polytopic supraventricular extrasystoles (38 in total). When performing the planned load in the form of climbing stairs, the heart rate reached 106 and 110 per minute (submaximal heart rate was not achieved), fatigue in the legs was noted. Against the background of the initial depression of the ST segment up to 2 mm, due to the complete blockade of the left leg of the His bundle, during the execution of the planned load, an increase in ST segment depression up to 4.0 mm is recorded, which can be regarded as a circulatory disorder.

Discharged from the Military Medical Academy on February 02, 2016. Total treatment days were 4. 
The final diagnosis was made on January 28, 2016. ICD code: C97 
    Total radiation dose 0.78 mSv. 
    Clinical outcome: improvement. 
Complaints at admission: contact with the patient is impossible due to the severity of the condition, pronounced signs of discirculatory encephalopathy
Anamnesis of the disease: According to the submitted medical documentation, since 1982 he has been suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (with VVC, fasting hyperglycemia of 8.0 mmol/l was detected). Regularly followed the diet and the prescribed treatment, the blood sugar level did not exceed 8 mmol/l. 
Coronary heart disease for more than 20 years, was repeatedly treated in a hospital. During the last 3 years, exertional angina pectoris was noted at the level of 2-3 functional class. At attacks took kardikt with positive effect. 
Hypertension for 18 years. The maximum increase in blood pressure is up to 160/100 mm Hg, the minimum is 100/60 mm Hg. Didn't take therapy. 
In 1993, TUR for prostate adenocarcinoma. In the future, there was an increase in PSA over 600 pg/ml (N<4). Registered with a urologist. Last inspection in 2014
2013 a neoplasm of the thyroid gland with metastasis to the lymph nodes of the neck was suspected. Consulted by an endocrinologist - multinodular euthyroid goiter of the 1st degree. 
2013 - revealed polylymphadenopathy of the neck, incl. Virchow knot. 
06/09/2014 - bilateral hilar pneumonia. 
16.12.2014 - revealed an increase in ESR 36 mm/h, Leu 13.9*109/l, LF 60%, Hb 116g/l. This issue has not been investigated.
A real deterioration in the last weeks (according to the words of the accompanying daughter), when, against the background of relative well-being (he moved around the room on his own), weakness and fatigue began to increase sharply, subfebrile condition was noted, and he has not been getting out of bed for the past few days. Given the appearance of interruptions in the work of the heart, an ECG was performed, a paroxysm of atrial fibrillation was suspected. According to urgent indications, he was delivered to the GT clinic on a stretcher. Upon careful analysis of the ECG, it was determined that these ECG changes were the result of frequent supraventricular extrasystole against the background of sinus rhythm. 
The patient was immediately reported to the management of the clinic. Considering the severity of the comorbid pathology, a decision was made to hospitalize the patient in the ICU.
Objectively at the time of admission: the condition is severe, prognostically unfavorable, due to severe comorbid, including oncological pathology in a patient of senile age. 
The skin is dry, pale, tissue turgor is sharply reduced. palpable cervical lymph nodes, Virchow's node on the left, not soldered to the underlying tissues, dense. Pastosity of legs and feet. The level of consciousness is stun. The patient is exhausted very quickly during minimal intercourse. Answers questions and follows simple commands. Manifestations of encephalopathy of mixed genesis are expressed. 
Hemodynamic parameters are stable. Hell 136/78 mmHg Art. Pulse = heart rate = 87 per minute. Rhythmic, symmetrical, synchronous, satisfactory filling, not tense. heart sounds are rhythmic, muffled, systolic murmur over the apex, weakening of the first tone.
The chest is of the correct form, symmetrical. the right half lags somewhat behind the left in the act of breathing 
. Shortening of percussion sound from the level of the sixth rib on the right. In the same place, a sharp weakening of breathing is heard, up to its complete absence. On the left above the lower sections, there is a weakening of breathing and scattered moist fine bubbling rales.
The abdomen is not swollen. On palpation, soft, painless in all departments. On the anterior abdominal wall there is a postoperative scar from a median laparotomy. In the mesogastrium, a rounded formation is palpable, dense, not soldered to the underlying tissues, 7 x 7 cm, displaced and painless on palpation. peristalsis is heard. A digital examination revealed brown stools without admixture of blood. Tapping on the lower back is painless. CVP - 30 mm. The expressed dehydration, the phenomena of a respiratory alkalosis is defined. The rate of diuresis is reduced due to hypovolemia. 

During hospitalization, stabilization of hemodynamics, respiratory function was achieved, the patient is discharged to the outpatient stage under the supervision of an oncologist at the polyclinic.

      Clinical outcome: Dropped out with improvement 
      On admission: 
      Complaints: interruptions in the work of the heart during the last 2 hours. severe shortness of breath when walking (distance not less than 10 m), fatigue, severe general weakness.
      History of the disease: Patient considers himself since 2008, when 3 weeks after suffering lacunar tonsillitis first developed paroxysm of atrial fibrillation, complicated by the development of pulmonary edema. A military hospital was hospitalized, where acute infectious-immune myocarditis was diagnosed, complex treatment was carried out. After discharge, the patient noted frequent attacks of palpitations (1-2 times a week), accompanied by severe general weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness. In view of this, in the period from 2008 to 2012, he was repeatedly hospitalized in various hospitals in St. Petersburg with paroxysms of atrial fibrillation (AF). The disease was complicated twice by the development of cardiogenic arrhythmic shock (2008 and 2009). In 2010, during the next hospitalization, thromboembolism of small branches of the pulmonary artery was diagnosed. On an outpatient basis, he received cordarone with an unstable effect. The active use of antiarrhythmic therapy was limited by the fact that against the background of intravenous administration of cordarone, the development of toxic hepatitis was noted with an increase in aminotransferases by more than 50 times (!), and when administered orally at a maintenance dose of 100 mg / day. - ALT level was within 2-3 upper limits of normal. The development of postmyocardial remodeling and dilatation of the left chambers of the heart (diffuse hypokinesia and myocardium, left ventricular ejection fraction 20%, dilatation of the anterior-posterior size of the left atrium 52 mm) did not allow the use of group 1C drugs for long-term continuous use. In 2012, a protracted paroxysm of AF developed. Against this background, 88 episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (up to 10 seconds) were recorded during daily ECG monitoring. On April 27, 2012, RF catheter isolation and catheter ablation of the cavatricuspid isthmus were performed at Almazov Federal Center for Emergencies under the conditions of CARTO 3 electroanatomical mapping using a circular diagnostic electrode. When performing a control endocardial electrophysiological study, ventricular arrhythmias were not provoked, data for the WPW syndrome were not obtained, sinus rhythm was maintained, cordarone therapy in combination with β-adrenoblockers (bisoprolol) was continued, but after three days on April 30, 2012, a hemodynamically significant paroxysmal AF requiring repeated electrical cardioversion. Despite the treatment, during 2012-2013, paroxysms of the tachysystolic form of AF continued to be recorded, clinically asymptomatic, which were stopped by intravenous administration of cordarone. In July 2014, against the background of another paroxysm of AF, cardiogenic pulmonary edema developed, which required electrical cardioversion for health reasons. For this reason, July 30, 2014 In the conditions of FGBU "FTsSKE named after V.A. Almazov" repeated radiofrequency catheter ablation of arrhythmogenic zones of the left and right atria was performed using a Lasso circular diagnostic electrode under conditions of CartoXP electroanatomical mapping. Carrying out this type of treatment made it possible to stabilize the patient's condition and stop using cordarone until March 2015 (on March 16, 2015, cordarone was resumed due to the development of recurrent episodes of atypical atrial flutter, which were stopped by stationary electrical cardioversion). At the next examination of cardiac surgeons-arrhythmologists of the Federal State Budgetary Institution "FCSKE named after V.A. Almazov", there were no indications for surgical treatment, it was recommended to continue monitoring and prophylactic administration of cordarone (according to the ECHO-ECG performed at that time, against the background of diffuse myocardial hypokinesia, there was a decrease in EF to 18 %). According to the patient, from the second half of 2015, edema in the legs began to increase, the abdomen increased in size, exercise tolerance decreased significantly, he began to get tired quickly, and shortness of breath developed with slight physical exertion. Associating deterioration of health with cordarone, the patient stopped taking it. During October-December 2015, the patient regularly took diuretics (furosemide, veroshpiron), ACE inhibitors, however, the state of health and condition progressively worsened during January: shortness of breath appeared in a horizontal position, difficulties arose when moving around the apartment, and therefore, for urgent medical reasons, he was hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the hospital therapy clinic. During the treatment with the use of Levosimendan (2 doses), there was an improvement in well-being. After discharge from CHT, a paroxysm of atrial fibrillation developed, which was stopped by electrical cardioversion at the Pokrovskaya hospital. During the same period, the patient was actively asked to join the waiting list for a heart transplant. On March 1, Levosimendan was re-introduced as planned. He followed the prescribed therapy at the outpatient stage and felt well. Despite this, at about 07:00 on April 21, 2016, the patient developed a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, accompanied by a progressive increase in severe weakness, decrease in blood pressure. Hospitalized in the hospital therapy clinic.

CLINICAL OUTCOME: Discharged with improvement 
AT ADMISSION: Fell ill on 05/09/2016, around 21:00, when there was a feeling of heat all over the body and in the head, the pulse disappeared. Called an ambulance. A similar condition (with the development of pre-syncope states) is noted for the first time.
In history - a long course of hypertension, myocardial infarction in 2005 and 2013, angioplasty with stenting of the anterior interventricular artery in March 2013, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, COPD, varicose veins of the lower extremities. He is periodically hospitalized due to the unstable course of angina pectoris in hospitals of the city, however, the patient does not describe anginal pain and reports that episodes of strong heartbeat served as the reason for hospitalization. The last hospitalization for this reason was in June 2013. Since that time, anginal pain and episodes of arrhythmias have not recurred. He has not received the prescribed therapy since March-April 2014. Tolerance to physical activity, while it was quite satisfactory. Working as a cardboard cutter work is associated with moderate (to intense) physical activity. He also notes an episodic increase in blood pressure up to 180/100 mm Hg. Art., which associates with changes in the weather. He considers 140/80 mm Hg to be working figures. Art. However, regular monitoring of blood pressure figures does not produce. A real deterioration in well-being developed on the night of May 10, 2016, when complaints that were not typical for the patient appeared, manifested by a sensation of "flushing to the head", pulsation in the temporal regions, a feeling of heat throughout the body, "lack of pulse" in the radial arteries. At the time of the arrival of the ambulance team, and after feeling better, against the background of ongoing treatment, there were again complaints of severe weakness, defocusing of vision, accompanied by syncope. The patient notes a three-time short-term loss of consciousness.
Past injuries, surgeries, diseases (dates, received treatment for them): angioplasty and stenting of the anterior interventricular artery in March 2013

HOSPITAL LIST: a certificate of incapacity for work was issued No. from 31.05 to 03.06.2016.         
WORK CAPABILITY: restored 
TOTAL RADIATION DOSE: 0.06 mSv
CLINICAL OUTCOME: Dropped out with improvement 
ON ADMISSION: Complaints of shortness of breath that occurs with little physical exertion (walking around the room), general weakness, swelling of the legs.
Anamnesis of the disease: at the age of 19, she had a sore throat, according to the patient - a severe course. Subsequently, at the age of 20, mitral heart disease was diagnosed. In 1975, a combined mitral heart disease was formed with a predominance of stenosis of the left atrioventricular orifice with clinical manifestations of cardiac decompensation, for which a commissurotomy was performed in the XUV-1 clinic in the same year. After the rehabilitation period, the patient's condition and well-being improved significantly, her ability to work was restored, she worked in the Military Medical Academy in responsible positions at the headquarters of the academy. According to the patient, at the age of about 60 years, hypertension was diagnosed with an increase in blood pressure to 180/100 mm Hg. Art., in connection with which she began to constantly take antihypertensive drugs - ACE inhibitors, CCBs. Against the background of ongoing therapy, blood pressure stabilized at the level of 130-140 / 70-80 mm Hg. Art. About 10 years ago, interruptions in the work of the heart with palpitations began to disturb - a paroxysmal form of atrial fibrillation of the tachy-brady type (SSSU) was diagnosed, at the same time a PEKS (DDDR) was installed. According to the milestone documents (discharge records from the clinics of the Military Medical Academy, where she was treated), there are indications that the patient was diagnosed with angina pectoris FC 2, and in 2007 she suffered a small focal myocardial infarction. In 2014, coronary angiography was performed at the XUV-1 clinic - the right type of myocardial blood supply, 20% stenosis of the mouth of the OA, 20% stenosis of the PAD. On 04/01/2016, Sorin Replay DR PEX was reimplanted with a base frequency of 60 per minute. But despite the ongoing therapy, the state of health progressively worsened, shortness of breath began to increase, general weakness, decreased exercise tolerance, swelling of the lower extremities occurred, and due to increasing circulatory failure against the background of restenosis of the left atrioventricular orifice, on May 21, 2015, a surgical intervention was performed in the XUV-1 clinic - mitral valve replacement with a Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT framed bioprosthesis Plus - 27 mm under IR and HCP conditions. Rehabilitation treatment from June 4 to August 21 took place in the TUV-2 clinic. According to the discharge epicrisis, paroxysms of atrial fibrillation-flutter acquired a persistent character; in early 2016, the patient turned to cardiologists about the possibility of arresting atrial fibrillation-flutter and restoring sinus rhythm, but taking into account echocardiography data (significant atrial dilatation, a long history of the disease) from active restoration of the rhythm, it was decided to abstain, and tactics of heart rate control were chosen. The patient receives: xarelto 15 mg per day, lozap 25 mg 2 times a day, bisoprolol 7.5 mg per day, inspra 25 mg per day, torasemide 10 mg every other day. However, despite the ongoing therapy, during the last week she began to notice a significant decrease in exercise tolerance, difficulty moving within the apartment due to shortness of breath, an increase in swelling of the lower extremities, and therefore, according to urgent indications, due to an increase in manifestations of circulatory insufficiency, she was hospitalized in the ICU clinic of hospital therapy. 5 mg per day, inspra 25 mg per day, torasemide 10 mg every other day. However, despite the ongoing therapy, during the last week she began to notice a significant decrease in exercise tolerance, difficulty moving within the apartment due to shortness of breath, an increase in swelling of the lower extremities, and therefore, according to urgent indications, due to an increase in manifestations of circulatory insufficiency, she was hospitalized in the ICU clinic of hospital therapy. 5 mg per day, inspra 25 mg per day, torasemide 10 mg every other day. However, despite the ongoing therapy, during the last week she began to notice a significant decrease in exercise tolerance, difficulty moving within the apartment due to shortness of breath, an increase in swelling of the lower extremities, and therefore, according to urgent indications, due to an increase in manifestations of circulatory insufficiency, she was hospitalized in the ICU clinic of hospital therapy.

CLINICAL OUTCOME: Dropped out with chronicity ON ADMISSION 
: Complaints of general weakness, shortness of breath with minor physical exertion, swelling of the legs.
In 1962, after suffering from a sore throat, aching pains and swelling of large joints appeared. He was treated in the city hospital of Tomsk for rheumatism with a positive effect. Before 1966 According to the patient, he regularly underwent prophylactic bicillin therapy. in 1966 entered the Sanitary and Hygienic Institute in Leningrad, from which he graduated in 1972. Since 1972 served in the army as an epidemiologist, finished his service in the Navy. According to the patient and according to the submitted medical milestone documents, the deterioration of health since the late 90s, in 2000. was treated at the VMHT clinic for chronic rheumatic heart disease, complete A-B blockade. In 2001, PEX was installed in DDD mode. In subsequent years, he was repeatedly treated in the clinics of the Military Medical Academy due to emerging paroxysms of tachycardia, and persistent atrial fibrillation was diagnosed. By 2013 progressively increased heart failure, troubled dyspnea, increased swelling of the lower extremities, at the same time, PEKS was reimplanted in the DDD/e mode of the patient, combined aortic heart disease with a predominance of insufficiency was verified, and on 15.01. also coronary angiography and arto-coronary bypass (one bypass). (There are no data on the results of coronary angiography.) But despite the aortic valve replacement, heart failure persisted, ejection fraction was 35%-28%, in 2014-2015. frequent hospitalizations in VMedA clinics. In the spring of 2016, despite the outpatient treatment, circulatory decompensation began to increase again, on May 11, 2016. by ambulance to the SZgmu named after I.I. Mechnikov with progressive heart failure. PE, infarction-pneumonia of the right lung was diagnosed, anticoagulant, antibacterial therapy was started, signs of hepatocellular insufficiency, anemic syndrome were noted. Against the background of taking warfarin (INR dated May 23, 2016 - 7.25) 05/24/2016 intestinal bleeding occurred, accompanied by milena, a decrease in hemoglobin levels to 62 g / l. An EGD was performed, but there were no signs of bleeding. It was decided to abstain from fibrocolonoscopy due to the severity of the patient's condition. Blood transfusion was performed twice, against the background of which on June 1, 2016. hemoglobin level 79 g/l. According to the discharge epicrisis dated 2.06. 2016 positive dynamics was achieved in the form of relief of peripheral edema, a positive x-ray picture from the lungs: a significant decrease in fluid in the pleural cavities. The patient continued to complain of shortness of breath with slight physical exertion and persistence of edema of the legs and feet, severe general weakness and sought medical help at the Military Medical Academy and, according to a report, was hospitalized at the hospital therapy clinic in the ICU for urgent medical reasons.

AT DISCHARGE: The patient has an extremely high cardiovascular, arrhythmogenic and hemorrhagic risk. The degree and severity of damage to the heart muscle does not determine the severity of the condition. The dominant is the pathology of the liver, manifested by the development of cirrhosis, hepatosplenomegaly and severe hypoproteinemia, which contributes to the development of significant edema, impaired coagulation, the threat of thrombo-hemorrhagic syndrome. The development of cirrhosis in a patient is indicated not only by structural changes in the liver, enlargement of the veins of the portal system, detected by ultrasound, but also by a significant decrease in protein-synthetic function, a decrease in the level of calcium and magnesium in blood plasma. Given the nature and extent of myocardial changes, the contribution of cardiac dysfunction to the development of cirrhosis is minimal, which allows us to consider cirrhosis as cryptogenic, and considering 10 points on the Child-Pugh scale, one can state decompensation of the course of cirrhosis without signs of portal hypertension (an EGD was performed, as a result of which no data were obtained on the presence of esophageal varicose veins). Therefore, cirrhosis of the liver is currently the main contribution to the severity of the patient's condition with the disease. Neoplastic process has not been proven. The results of the study of tumor markers with a positive result and an increase of more than two times Gl 19-9 Ag (86.8 U/l) may be determined by the presence of liver damage. cirrhosis of the liver is currently the main contribution to the severity of the condition of the patient with the disease.

TOTAL RADIATION DOSE: 6.86 mSv 
CLINICAL OUTCOME: Eliminated with improvement
AT ADMISSION: About 15 years old, hypertension is diagnosed with an increase in blood pressure to 160-170/90-100 mm Hg. Art. maximum, usually while taking hypotensive blood pressure 130-140/80-70 mm Hg. Art. she did not resort to emergency medical services, she usually takes ACE inhibitors, b-blockers. During the same time, coronary heart disease is diagnosed, there are no clinical data for the development of angina pectoris, but according to the records in the medical book and the data of milestone medical documents, there are indications of a myocardial infarction suffered in 2006 (ECHO-KG was performed on June 1, 2016: local myocardial contractility and global are not disturbed, ejection fraction 66%, diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle). Since 2010 The patient is diagnosed with cancer of the right breast, at the Research Institute of Oncology. N.N. Petrov underwent a right-sided mastectomy, a course of polychemotherapy and until 2015. health was quite satisfactory, but at the end of 2015. Colon cancer was diagnosed on 01/27/2016. the tumor was resected, then two months later, 3 courses of chemotherapy were performed, but since April of this year, she began to experience difficulty walking, muscle weakness, and since May 2016. difficulty in maintaining the head in a vertical position, then shortness of breath began to bother, on May 25, 2016, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen was performed: thrombosis of the branches of the right and left pulmonary arteries, thrombosis of the portal vein. May 26, 2016 She was hospitalized at the Propaedeutics Clinic for Internal Diseases, treated with Clexane and Eliquis, and was discharged on 10.06.2016. In connection with the deterioration of well-being during the last days in the form of an increase in shortness of breath, especially at night, she turned today to the CDC of the Military Medical Academy, where cardiac asthma, pulmonary embolism were suspected. The patient, for urgent medical reasons, was referred for hospitalization to the hospital therapy clinic.
      Upon admission, the condition was regarded as severe, due to the increasing phenomena of respiratory failure. When performing angio-CT data for PE was not received. During the first day of stay, IVL was performed (NIV, support pressure 15 cm wg FiO2 30%), however, on the night of June 17-18, a loss of consciousness developed, accompanied by tachycardia, the development of hypotension, tachypnea, and clonic convulsions. The patient was transferred to a ventilator. During this period, the dynamics of the ECG shows transmural damage in the area of ​​the lower wall with a transition to the side wall, the apex. By the time of development, these changes coincided with the time of impaired consciousness and developed against the background of relatively stable hemodynamics in the absence of signs of rhythm disturbance. Considering the increase in CPK (general), CPK-MB (these changes have been observed over the past 2 weeks), 3-fold increase in troponin levels. When performing MRI of the head, data on stroke were not obtained. Coronary angiography revealed a multiple stenosing lesion of the coronary bed with a pronounced collateral network. There were no signs of acute plaque ulceration.
      The severity of the condition is due to the development of severe pulmonary heart failure, mutually potentiating each other. Dominant in the clinical picture were ventilation disorders, which were stopped only with the use of mechanical ventilation. Their genesis, most likely, is of a mixed nature: as a result of multiple courses of polychemotherapy, recurrent attacks of thromboembolism, muscle weakness developed that did not allow the patient to take a full breath on his own, diffuse pneumofibrosis with the development of pronounced restrictive changes (which manifests itself, among other things, in a significant increase in lung compliance) and decrease in the respiratory surface, as well as the presence of acute cardiovascular insufficiency, which aggravates the process of gas exchange in the alveoli, requiring constant maintenance of positive end-expiratory pressure. Damage to the heart is diffuse in nature with predominant damage to the lower wall. This damage contributes to some decrease in systolic function, however, diastolic disorders due to fibrosis of the heart muscle are leading in the development of heart failure.
      During June 18-21, the patient received mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. Subsequently, after extubation, she was systematically transferred to IVL, insufflation with an oxygen flow. At present, the maximum possible compensation for pulmonary heart failure has been achieved. The optimal therapy was selected - normotension, respiratory rate less than 22/min, SaO2 when breathing atmospheric air 95-98%. Infrequent short-term episodes of acute respiratory failure are noted, well stopped by insufflation with an oxygen flow.

CLINICAL OUTCOME: Dropped out with improvement ON ADMISSION 
: Complaints on admission to general weakness, shortness of breath, aggravated by slight physical exertion, swelling of the lower extremities
In 1962, after suffering from a sore throat, aching pains and swelling of large joints appeared. He was treated in the city hospital of Tomsk for rheumatism with a positive effect. Before 1966 According to the patient, he regularly underwent prophylactic bicillin therapy. in 1966 entered the Sanitary and Hygienic Institute in Leningrad, from which he graduated in 1972. Since 1972 served in the army as an epidemiologist, finished his service in the Navy. According to the patient and according to the submitted medical milestone documents, the deterioration of health since the late 90s, in 2000. was treated at the VMHT clinic for chronic rheumatic heart disease, complete A-B blockade. In 2001, PEX was installed in DDD mode. In subsequent years, he was repeatedly treated in the clinics of the Military Medical Academy due to emerging paroxysms of tachycardia, and persistent atrial fibrillation was diagnosed. By 2013 progressively increased heart failure, troubled dyspnea, increased swelling of the lower extremities, at the same time, PEKS was reimplanted in the DDD/e mode of the patient, combined aortic heart disease with a predominance of insufficiency was verified, and on 15.01. also coronary angiography and arto-coronary bypass (one bypass). (There are no data on the results of coronary angiography.) But despite the aortic valve replacement, heart failure persisted, ejection fraction was 35%-28%, in 2014-2015. frequent hospitalizations in VMedA clinics. In the spring of 2016, despite the outpatient treatment, circulatory decompensation began to increase again, on May 11, 2016. by ambulance at the North-Western State Medical University named after I.I. Mechnikov with progressive heart failure. PE, infarction-pneumonia of the right lung was diagnosed, anticoagulant, antibacterial therapy was started, signs of hepatocellular insufficiency, anemic syndrome were noted. Against the background of taking warfarin (INR dated May 23, 2016 - 7.25) 05/24/2016 intestinal bleeding occurred, accompanied by melena, a decrease in hemoglobin levels to 62 g / l. An EGD was performed, but there were no signs of bleeding. It was decided to abstain from fibrocolonoscopy due to the severity of the patient's condition. Blood transfusion was performed twice, against the background of which on June 1, 2016. hemoglobin level 79 g/l. According to the discharge epicrisis dated June 2, 2016. positive dynamics was achieved in the form of relief of peripheral edema, a positive x-ray picture from the lungs: a significant decrease in fluid in the pleural cavities, but after being discharged from the hospital, he spent only a few days at home and due to increasing edema, severe general weakness, shortness of breath was again hospitalized in the ICU of the hospital therapy clinic, where he was treated from June 2, 2016 to 17 06. 2016.

AT DISCHARGE: Patient of extremely high cardiovascular, arrhythmogenic risk. The degree and severity of damage to the heart muscle determines the severity of the condition in part. The dominant is the pathology of the liver, manifested by the development of cirrhosis, hepatosplenomegaly and severe hypoproteinemia, which contributes to the development of extremely severe edema, impaired coagulation, and the threat of thrombo-hemorrhagic syndrome. The development of cirrhosis in a patient is indicated not only by structural changes in the liver, enlargement of the veins of the portal system, detected by ultrasound, but also by a significant decrease in protein-synthetic function, a decrease in the level of calcium and magnesium in blood plasma. Given the nature and extent of myocardial changes, the contribution of cardiac dysfunction to the development of cirrhosis is minimal, which allows us to consider cirrhosis as cryptogenic, and considering 10 points on the Child-Pugh scale, one can state decompensation of the course of cirrhosis without signs of portal hypertension (an EGD was performed, as a result of which no data were obtained on the presence of esophageal varicose veins). Therefore, cirrhosis of the liver is currently the main contribution to the severity of the patient's condition with the disease. Neoplastic process has not been proven. The results of the study of tumor markers with a positive result and an increase of more than two times Gl 19-9 Ag (86.8 U/l) may be determined by the presence of liver damage. cirrhosis of the liver is currently the main contribution to the severity of the condition of the patient with the disease.

     The patient was admitted by internal transfer from the clinic of naval surgery with a diagnosis of transfer of "PE", the phenomena of multiple organ failure, the leading of which at the time of admission were decompensation of cardiopulmonary insufficiency, liver failure. Upon admission, a syndrome of disseminated intravascular coagulation was diagnosed, which is currently stopped. Among the reasons for the development of jaundice, suprahepatic mechanism was assumed (hemolysis as a source excluded when examined by a hematologist), hepatic mechanism (autoimmune, cryptogenic, viral, toxic nature), which were not confirmed during the examination. As part of the differential search, the patient underwent a CT scan of the chest and abdomen in the angio mode on April 5, 2017, which revealed signs of changes in the terminal part of the common choledochus, probably neoplastic character, enlarged regional lymph node between the wall of the duodenum and the head of the pancreas. In the diagnosis, it was planned to exclude a neoplastic process.
     
     The patient categorically refused to be transferred to a surgical hospital in the presence of relatives and witnesses. 
     Discharged to the clinic at the place of residence under the supervision of a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, oncologist. 
     
     Recommended 
• Hospitalization in an oncology hospital to determine the nature of changes in the terminal part of the common choledochus, to make a decision on further treatment tactics. 
• CT angiography images dated April 5, 2017 handed out

      This block includes a number of mental disorders grouped together on the basis of the presence of clear etiological factors, namely, the cause of these disorders was brain disease, brain injury or stroke, leading to cerebral dysfunction. Dysfunction can be primary (as in diseases, brain injuries and strokes that directly or selectively affect the brain) and secondary (as in systemic diseases or disorders when the brain is involved in the pathological process along with other organs and systems).
      Dementia [dementia] (F00-F03) is a syndrome caused by damage to the brain (usually chronic or progressive) in which many higher cortical functions are impaired, including memory, thinking, orientation, understanding, counting, learning ability, speech and judgment. Consciousness is not obscured. Cognitive decline is usually accompanied, and sometimes preceded, by deterioration in control of emotions, social behavior, or motivation. This syndrome is noted in Alzheimer's disease, in cerebrovascular diseases, and in other conditions that primarily or secondarily affect the brain. 
      If necessary, an additional code is used to identify the underlying disease.

Discharged from the Military Medical Academy on September 20, 2017. A total of 15 days of treatment were carried out. 
The final diagnosis was made on September 06, 2017. No certificate of 
incapacity for work was issued . Ability to work was 
not restored, observation / continued treatment / in a specialized pulmonology hospital was recommended 
. Clinical outcome: improvement.
      
      Medical history: The patient has a long history of hypertension (over 32 years). Since March 2017, he has been noted the appearance of an unmotivated unproductive cough and shortness of breath with moderate physical exertion. When seeking medical help, this condition was initially regarded as a reaction to taking ACE inhibitors, which were canceled without a positive effect. In the future, she noted an increase in shortness of breath, a decrease in tolerance to physical exertion and an increase in coughing to hacking. In the period from 03 to 14 August, she was in the clinic of GT VMedA, where idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was verified. Chronic subcompensated cor pulmonale. DN 1-2 tbsp. After starting to take methylprednisolone at a dose of 30 mg/day, she noted an increase in exercise tolerance, complete relief of cough. Deterioration has been noted since the end of August 2017, when she noted the appearance of a rare cough, increased dyspnea to the level of rest, increased dryness in the mouth, the appearance of unmotivated thirst, a rapid increase in general weakness and fatigue. The above circumstances served as the basis for seeking medical help.
      On admission September 06, 2017 complaints of severe general weakness (inability to stand), mixed dyspnea at rest, aggravated with minimal physical exertion, moderate cough with mucopurulent sputum of moderate volume, dry mouth and thirst, dry skin, periodic swelling of the legs to the lower thirds of the legs .
      The general condition was regarded as severe, due to severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose 47 mmol/l, urinary ketosis, metabolic acidosis in arterial blood is compensated by respiratory alkalosis), severe hypoalbuminemia (23 g/l) and hypoproteinemia (46 g/l), severe hypoperfusion of peripheral tissues against the background of hypovolemia (CVP negative. BP with a tendency to hypotension 90-105 / 50-70 mm Hg, tachycardia up to 115 / min, signs of acute damage to a single kidney, oliguria), respiratory failure (RR 28-36 / min; SaO2 when breathing atmospheric air 86%, against the background of insufflation with an oxygen flow of 5 l / min 95%), expressed by general muscle weakness.
      On the background of the therapy on September 11, vomiting with small flakes of hematin appeared, with FGDS, diapedetic bleeding from the surface of the mucosa and single small erosions of the stomach drew attention. Considering a significant decrease in hemoglobin to 60 g/l (including against the background of hemodilution due to active infusion therapy in the previous days in the treatment of hyperglycemia) and hypocoagulation, a single-group transfusion was performed [A2B (IV) Rh (-) neg. Kell (-) neg. dCĉēē] blood, plasma, albumin.
      In the course of the treatment, stabilization of hemodynamics was achieved at the level of normotension, sinus normosystole, respiratory failure was subcompensated (when breathing atmospheric air → SaO2 95-98%), glycemia compensation (6.0-10.0 mmol/l), kidney function was compensated (diuresis adequate water load without additional stimulation), hypoperfusion and hypovolemia were stopped, the severity of general weakness was partially reduced. At the control CT scan of the lungs (on the arms) there are signs of subtotal damage by idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis. 
      Currently, he does not need further stay in the intensive care unit and intensive care unit. Further treatment under the supervision of a pulmonologist.
      The patient is shown to continue GCS therapy in the amount of 4.5 tablets of methylprednisolone per day (in the morning, under the cover of antacids and secretolytics), oxygen therapy on an ongoing basis through a concentrator, breathing exercises with PEEP, nebulizer therapy (Berodual 10 drops, Ambroxol 20 drops, physical therapy). r 1 ml - 2 times a day), measures to normalize the nutritional status, support carbohydrate metabolism, and activate the patient. A further systematic reduction in the dose of metipred is possible in the regimen of 0.5 tablets per week. The use of efferent therapy methods is currently unlikely due to the high risk of bleeding, hypoalbuminemia. Examination by a pulmonologist in dynamics.

COURSE OF THE DISEASE IN THE CLINIC OF HOSPITAL THERAPY:
On the part of the main organs and systems (cardiovascular, respiratory systems), the patient was compensated during the first day, the therapy selected at the previous stages of treatment was adjusted within the framework of the underlying and concomitant diseases. Stabilization of hemodynamics was confirmed during daily monitoring of ECG and blood pressure. During the examination with ultrasound of the abdomen and small pelvis, a polyp of the gallbladder, a violation of the rheology of bile, diffuse changes in the pancreas, thickening of the CHLS and cysts of both kidneys, as well as signs of chronic cystitis, diverticulum (formation?) Of the bladder, condition after subtotal resection of the adenoma prostate. At the initial X-ray examination of signs of hydrothorax, infiltrative changes were not detected. However, CT revealed a picture of congestive interstitial changes in the lungs against the background of COPD (pulmonary emphysema, signs of bronchitis, pneumofibrotic changes). Gon's foci, calcified lymph nodes of the right bronchopulmonary group, calcifications along the pleura on the right - posttuberculous changes. A small amount of fluid in the pleural cavity and pericardial cavity. Degenerative-dystrophic changes in the thoracic spine, as well as mixed replacement hydrocephalus of the brain. In order to clarify the nature of changes in the spine due to pain vertebrogenic syndrome, an x-ray examination of the chest was performed, which revealed static disturbances in the form of straightening of physiological lordosis and displacement of the bodies L3 posteriorly by 0.7 cm and L5 anteriorly by 0.9 cm (staircase listhesis). Reducing the height of the body L1 with wedge-shaped deformation of it due to a compression fracture. Osteochondrosis L2-3, L3-4, L4-5 motor segments with symptoms of spondylosis. diffuse osteoporosis. In blood tests, the decrease in the level of protein, urea, and cholesterol was explained not only by alimentary reasons, but also by a decrease in catabolic processes.
From the moment of admission, the clinical picture was dominated by pain syndrome caused by vertebrogenic pathology (degenerative-dystrophic disease of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Spondylarthrosis. Osteochondrosis of the lumbar spine with L2-L5. Compression uncomplicated stable fracture of the L1 vertebral body (of unknown age) with pain and radicular syndromes) against the background of neurological deficit. Due to severe pain and radicular syndromes, the patient is constantly in a forced horizontal position on the back, which increases the risk of developing vicarious complications: congestive pneumonia, thromboembolic catastrophes, soft tissue necrosis, progression of constipation events. Consulted by a neurologist (“Acute lumbodynia, possibly of vertebral origin. Cerebrovascular disease. stage II encephalopathy with vertebrobasilar insufficiency and moderate cognitive impairment”) and an orthopedist. The ongoing therapeutic measures, according to the principle of reasonableness and sufficiency, were aimed not only at the secondary prevention of life-threatening precedents, but also at improving the quality of life. Flupirtine, a non-opioid centrally acting analgesic, is used as a symptomatic therapy for pain syndrome; it was decided to refrain from NSAIDs (taking into account the high risk of nephrotoxicity and bleeding). In addition, the patient was examined by the Chief Specialist of the Military Medical Academy for physical therapy, and a course of exercise therapy was started. but also improve the quality of life.

In addition, the patient was examined by the Chief Specialist of the Military Medical Academy for physical therapy, and a course of exercise therapy was started.
On October 06, 2017, during a planned round of the ward, attention was drawn to the patient's drowsiness, does not respond to sound and tactile stimuli, and reacts to pain impulses. Due to a sharp increase in neurological deficit, a high risk of developing hypostatic, aspiration pneumonia, the need for dynamic monitoring of vital functions, as well as in order to eliminate and prevent life-threatening conditions, the patient was transferred to the ICU.
In the ICU, a neurologist ruled out stroke, diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome, which was successfully compensated by PK-Merz injections, as well as congestive pneumonia in the basal parts of the lungs. Performed FBS (deformation of the lumen of the middle third of the trachea due to compression from the outside, deformation of the right main bronchus and left bronchus due to compression from the outside along the medial wall, chronic diffuse deforming endobronchitis, exacerbation). In view of the development of nosocomial pneumonia, an analysis of washing water was taken, in which a multidrug-resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumanii was identified (06.10.2017). Against the background of the treatment, by October 10, a moderate positive effect was achieved in the form of achieving the target indicators of the work of internal organs against the background of pronounced age-related dystrophic changes. In the course of bilateral congestive pneumonia, a significant positive trend was registered. Respiratory alkalosis was predominantly of central origin (deep breathing without tachypnea).
Senile lesions of the central nervous system and signs of sarcopenia with the development of muscle weakness and age-related dementia remained dominant in the picture of the disease. The patient was transferred to the cardiology department for comprehensive care, regular external monitoring of prescribed medications, prevention of bedsores and congestion (regular frequent changes in body position in bed, percussion massage, exercise therapy).
The course of the disease was characterized by a progressive increase in encephalopathy phenomena in the form of an organic brain disease of mixed genesis with severe cognitive impairment, hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia, sarco- and dynamopenia, intoxication syndrome, which manifested itself in the formation of the day-night inversion (wakefulness between 15:00 and 04:00) and signs of dementia, an increase in the severity of general weakness, congestion in the basal parts of the lungs, the appearance of subfebrile fever, a tendency of hemodynamics to hypotension, decubitus heel areas (the appearance of cyanosis of the skin on 16.10, examined by a surgeon on 17.10 - “forming bedsores” were verified). As a symptomatic therapy, transfusion of two doses of albumin was performed. Changes in urine sediment were associated with the presence of an epicystostomy, the toilet of which was carried out daily. Despite the relative stability of the patient in general therapeutic terms, there were still high risks of life-threatening nosocomial complications. The combination of a high risk of developing life-threatening thromboembolism (PADUA scale = 7 points) and an equally low risk of bleeding (H. DECOSUS scale = 12.5 points) predetermined a personalized approach to antithrombotic therapy. Severe cognitive impairment prevented from conducting endoscopic studies. Taking into account the extremely high risk of falls (HENDRIK II = 6 points), an individual medical and nursing station was created, the patient was placed in the maximum allowable place from the alarm call button, the height of the bed was lowered to the minimum allowable level, and the construction of bed rails. During the entire hospitalization, both current and final disinfection was carried out. high risks of life-threatening nosocomial complications persisted.

However, despite the entire sector of medical and nursing activities, during a planned round of the ward, attention was paid to the increasing drowsiness of the patient, does not respond to sound and tactile stimuli, and reacts to pain impulses. Due to a sharp increase in neurological deficit, a high risk of developing hypostatic, aspiration pneumonia, the need for dynamic monitoring of vital functions, as well as in order to eliminate and prevent life-threatening conditions, on October 18, the patient was again transferred to the intensive care unit.
On admission to the ICU, the patient's condition was severe. Consciousness is depressed to the level of a deep stupor, contact with the patient is difficult. The severity of the condition is determined by the increasing phenomena of multiple organ (hepatic, cardiac, respiratory, cerebral), predominantly respiratory failure in a polymorbid elderly patient against the background of nosocomial pneumonia. The skin is pale, dry, hematomas at the injection sites, multiple subcutaneous hematomas of the extremities. Visible mucous membranes are clean, pale. In the heel region on both sides at the site of contact with the mattress, bedsores with a diameter of about 5 cm are formed. Peripheral lymph nodes are not enlarged. The musculoskeletal system with signs of severe sarcopenia. hypoproteinemic edema is formed on the lower surface of the body. Pulse 60 in 1 min, low filling and tension, rhythmic. The left border of the heart along the left mid-clavicular line. BP 95/65 mmHg Art. Heart sounds are muffled, rhythmic, systolic murmur at the apex of the heart of moderate intensity. Breathing is hard, weakened in the lower sections, there is also a moderate amount of congestive rales against the background of a moderate amount of dry rales over all fields of the lungs. Respiratory rate 22 in 1 min. SaO2 98% against the background of constant insufflation with humidified oxygen. The tongue is moist, covered with a whitish coating.

From the moment of admission, the condition steadily worsened - the phenomena of respiratory failure, general intoxication, hypoproteinemia and hemostasis disorders increased. In the washings of the bronchi, a multi-resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumonia, as well as Acinetobacter baumanii, Enterococcus faecalis, was sown, in the urine and lungs - candida albicans. Based on the initial culture, ceftaroline (sensitivity unknown) and levofloxacin (susceptible to Acinetobacter baumanii), as well as inhaled Colistin and Dioxidine, were prescribed. As an antimycotic therapy - fluoknazol 200 mg / day + bladder lavage.
It was determined that hypoproteinemia is of a mixed nature. The main contribution is made by severe protein-synthetic dysfunction of the liver (senile and infectious dystrophy and fibrosis in combination with cardiac fibrosis). In addition, there is a high protein catabolism (including gluconeogenesis) under conditions of an active immune response against the background of an infectious process, which leads to a rapid breakdown of the administered albumin / plasma proteins and progressive saturation of the interstitial space with fluid with an increase in hypoproteinemic edema. This forms the ineffectiveness of low-dose albumin replacement therapy and increases the concentration of drugs, including antibacterial and antimycotic agents in plasma. The use of antibacterial agents in the absence of adequate drainage of the final part of the tracheobronchial tree predetermines the extremely low effectiveness of antibiotic therapy and forms the resistance of the systemic edematous syndrome and congestive manifestations in the lungs. The frequent absence of coagulation according to the result of the coagulogram, the increase in subcutaneous hemorrhagic manifestations, along with severe hypoproteinemia (low levels of globulins, proteins of the coagulation system against the background of protein synthesis insufficiency of the liver) required correction of the hemostasis system. The drug of choice in this situation was determined to be fresh frozen plasma as a medium with a wide range of plasma proteins and the most suitable option for "prosthetics" of existing disorders. Additionally, albumin infusions were performed to replenish and normalize oncotic pressure,
In view of the persistence of fever, a control R-gram of the chest was performed on 10/23/2017. on which congestion in the lungs increased. Increased amount of fluid in the pleural cavities with a tendency to encystation. Pneumonic infiltration persists in the lower sections of the lungs. On October 24, 2017, the sanation-diagnostic bronchoscopy was repeated. Due to the ineffectiveness of antibiotic therapy, based on the culture data on the sensitivity of microorganisms to antibiotics, ceftaroline was replaced with linezolid, and amikacin was prescribed by inhalation.
After 3 days, despite the change in antibiotic therapy, fever persisted, indicating an active infectious process. As a result of inoculation of washing water, a multi-resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumonia was determined (produces metallo-beta-lactamase NMD) with sensitivity to polyvalent Klebsiella bacteriophage, fosfomycin, colistin, tetracycline, tigecycline. In view of the absence of fosfomycin and bacteriophage in the supply service and the pharmacy network of the academy, a decision was made to increase the dose of Colistin administered up to 4 times a day. Given the resistance of the flora to amikacin (according to culture), its toxicity, as well as the systemic toxicity of levofloxacin, it was decided to cancel the further use of these drugs. The doses of administered Colistin were increased up to 4 times a day with its additional intrabronchial administration during fibrobronchoscopy. Fosfomycin, linezolid, and human polyvalent immunoglobulin were retained as part of complex antibacterial therapy.
In addition, the fact of sowing yeast-like fungi of the genus Candida ssp. in sputum and in large quantities in urine (urine culture was taken with the determination of sensitivity to antimycotics) indicated the formation of systemic mycosis against the background of a systemic immunosuppressive state, and the detection of Candida ssp. after frequent flushing of the urinary tract with fluconazole, along with their systemic use at a dose of 200 mg / day, it was urgent to change the antimycotic drug and conduct systemic therapy. The loading dose of voriconazole was reduced due to both its toxic effects and low levels of albumin and renal excretory function (low creatinine is not a reflection of a high glomerular filtration rate, but a consequence of severe sarcopenia), which creates the prerequisites for a higher concentration of the drug in the blood.
The change in antibiotic therapy did not affect the course of the disease - in the next three days, fever and respiratory failure persisted, and a rapid decrease in the previously introduced protein was noted. which needed to be corrected.
As a result of sowing the washings, a strain of Klebsiella pneumonia (producing metallo-beta-lactamase NMD) was sown with sensitivity to the polyvalent Klebsiella bacteriophage, fosfomycin, colistin, tetracycline, tigecycline. Due to the ineffectiveness of the ongoing complex antibacterial therapy with all antibiotics available in the Medical Academy, a decision was made for vital indications, in view of the direct threat to the life of the patient, to ask the leadership of the academy to purchase tigecycline (the use of this drug in nosocomial pneumonia caused by carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia is determined by the National Guidelines (Nosocomial pneumonia in adults: Russian national recommendations / under the editorship of B.R. Gelfand; editors-in-chief D.N. Protsenko, B.Z. Belotserkovsky - 2nd ed., revised and additional - Moscow: Medical Information Agency, 2016. - 176 p. [c. 133]).
During the X-ray examination of the chest on October 30, 2017. in the horizontal position of the patient in the conditions of the ICU without holding the breath, a pronounced negative trend was determined with a significant increase in the amount of encapsulated fluid, especially on the right, and subtotal infiltration of the right lung of an uneven nature, which does not exclude abscessing. Pleural empyema? A CT scan of the chest was performed immediately. Data for the presence of pleural empyema and abscessing pneumonia was not received. Bilateral middle hydrothorax with compression of the lower lobes of both lungs was revealed. The patient underwent evacuation of the pleural fluid.
Against the background of initiated therapy with tigecycline, the body temperature returned to normal in a day, the severity of respiratory failure decreased. Antibacterial therapy has been adjusted - it is represented by Tigecycline (Tygacil 50 mg 2 times a day), inhaled Colistin (4 million units / day) and Dioxidine (80 mg / day). 
In the obtained analysis of urine culture on November 01, an increase in Klebsiella pneumonia was detected. It was stated that there were no convincing data for ongoing candidiasis of the urinary and respiratory tract, and voriconazole therapy was discontinued. Due to the low level of potassium, its correction was initiated by a constant infusion of a 4% solution through a dispenser.
Against the background of ongoing therapy, a positive trend has been noted to date in the form of normalization of the function of external respiration, central hemodynamics, stabilization of body temperature, and improvement in cognitive phenomena. 

AT DISCHARGE: An 
elderly patient with symptoms of multiple organ failure. Complex therapy is being carried out aimed at achieving a stable relief of inflammation in the urinary system and respiratory tract caused by Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobater cloacae sensitive to tigecycline (the course of antibiotic therapy is completed). Active anti-decubitus measures made it possible to prevent the occurrence of new pressure sores, and the use of iodine-based preparations significantly improved the condition of pressure sores in the heel areas.
In blood tests, signs of respiratory alkalosis are determined, which is predominantly of central origin (deep breathing without tachypnea, episodes of the Kussmaul type). Most likely. this is a reflection of severe metabolic disorders of the microcirculation and the phenomena of renal failure. During sleep, the nature of breathing changes to Grokk, most likely due to severe atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels. Therapy was prescribed to correct the identified disorders. 
Senile lesions of the central nervous system, signs of sarcopenia with the development of muscle weakness and immobility, and age-related dementia remain dominant in the picture of the disease, which largely determines the development of complications.
The patient needs comprehensive care, regular external monitoring of prescribed medications, prevention of bedsores and congestion - regular frequent changes in body position in bed, percussion massage, exercise therapy 

RECOMMENDED: 
1. continue treatment in conditions of the possibility of providing auxiliary medical care and care. 
2. Strict adherence to anti-decubitus measures !!! 
3. Continue the course of selected therapy: 
- Omeprazole 40 mg - intravenously in the morning 
- PK-Merz 0.1 - 2 capsules in the morning and 1 capsule at 18:00 
- Spironolactone 25 mg - 1 tablet 2 times a day 
- Symbicort 160/45 mcg - 1 dose 2 times a day 
- Linex - 2 capsules 3 times a day 
- Through a nebulizer:
• Colistin 1 million units - 2 times a day for a week 
• Dioxidin 2 ml (dilute 2 times with saline sodium chloride solution) 3 times a day 
• Ambroxol 2 ml (dilute 2 times with saline sodium chloride solution) 2 times a day 
- Dermazin ointment - treatment of the exit area of ​​the urinary catheter 
- Brownadin - treatment of the heel area 2 times a day 
4. Daily toilet of the skin around the catheter with antiseptic solutions, change of aseptic sticker; heparin "lock" at the end of each infusion. 
5. Control of the level of total protein, albumin, coagulogram 1 time in 3 days. Correction if necessary
